            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>James Harrington</hi> Esquire, to give an account of my Political Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I found none at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, so meet to receive it as your selves. Your practices assure me, that between <hi>Your</hi> Judgments and Consciences, and <hi>Mine,</hi> there is no little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. And I think it not meet to differ in points, which our souls, and the Churches Peace depend on, without giving you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my Dissent. Some I understand are
<pb facs="tcp:170314:4"/> much offended, that I vindicate the honour of Providence, and the Protestant Religion, against the accusations of the Papists, by which they have made it odious abroad. But I am still of the Opinion, that the Honour of God, and the Gospel should be dearer to us, than the honour of those that sin against them: (and is so to every upright heart:) and that the truth of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents may be recorded, and History should be impartial, and Providence on both sides have its due. They that have not read such Books, as <hi>[The Scotish and English Presbytery discovered by a (pretended) French Divine, The Image of both Churches]</hi> and other Revilers and Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, and that know not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy that's cast on our names through most of the Christian world, are no fit Censurers of my words. While my hand may write I will never betray the Cause of Christ to Papists or Infidels, for fear of the displeasure of any that are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. And if I have thought that corruption tainted any of the Army, they thought so too that surprized them at <hi>Burford,</hi> that prosecuted <hi>Thompson</hi> and his Adherents, that shot some to death, imprisoned others, cashiered more (to pass by the rest.) Repentance doth not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie sins, but confess and forsake it: Nor doth it hate the Reprover, but rather the Tempter, and the Flatterer, and cometh with love and
<pb facs="tcp:170314:4"/> submission to the light, which the impenitent evil doers hate, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>I desire you to believe, that it is not from a time-serving spirit, nor want of love to your immortal souls, or of faithfulness to my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ancient Friends, nor of deep compassion on the Land of my Nativity, that I meddle not here with reproof or Aggravation of your sin. But it is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because that Doctrine must go before Application: It's meet that the Light be first set up, which by its manifesting efficacy may bring sincere ingenious minds to self-reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and freely to say more against themselves, then before they could endure to hear from others. And till this Light have discovered sinne, and humbled the soul, I find the most compassionate Reproofs do but exasperate, and seem reproaches; and all men are thought to hate the person that hate the sinne: Innocency and Penitence are much more patient, than guilt and impenitency are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because I find that self-conviction work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you, and hath brought you already to more confessions than Volumes of Arguments from me, were ever like to have procured. And when N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture hopefully begins a Cure, it must not be disturbed by violent Medicines. You have already discerned and confessed,
<pb facs="tcp:170314:5"/> that you <hi>contributed</hi> by your <hi>wanderings into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous paths,</hi> to our discomposed State! and that a <hi>special presence of God was with that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> which you then pull'd down, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out. The Officers of the Army in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> confess (as the Publick Intelligencer tells us, <hi>May</hi> 16.) That <hi>[Almost all the Assertors of a glorious Cause had manifestly declined it, by a defection of many years:]</hi> Adding, <hi>[We cannot but acknowledg to our exceeding great sorrow and shame, that our selves, though we hope most of us through weakness and frailty, not out of design, have very much contributed to those provocations, which have caused God to depart from our Israel: and we could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish, that even among those that help to make up your own number, there had not been an helping hand to this sad and deplorable work:]</hi> And therefore they <hi>beseech God [To heal the backslidings of his people, and not to charge unto their account in this his day of their deliverance, their miscarriages while they were wandering in dark and slippery places, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the imaginations of their own hearts.]</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Confessions will be some reparation of your honour. This much from another, in any of those many years, that you lived in the sinne, would by some have been called a second <hi>Gangrena,</hi> and a <hi>Scandalum magnatum:</hi> It is
<pb facs="tcp:170314:5"/> but lately that it was proclaimed Treason, to say, that <hi>[This Parliament is in being]</hi> A man might have been hang'd then, for saying that which is now publickly Declared. And if you be indeed sincerely penitent, we are not only in Hope, but past all doubt, that God who hath shewed you the sinne of forcing out the last hundred and twenty Members, will shew you also the sinne of the Imprisoning and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding above an hundred and fourty at once, long before. Some of them I am acquainted with, and have reason to judg them to be men so eminently wise and holy, as to be unlikely to be the betrayers of the Commonwealth. The keeping out also these men since; the calling of the nominal Little Parliament, the Fabrication of an Instrument of Laws without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many other actions of these times, we doubt not but you will ere long repent of: Finding you in so fair a beginning, I shall not disturb or exasperate you now, by the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or so much as describing of your sinnes, or giving them the Names which the Laws of God and man do give them. Only may I be bold to intreat you, impartially and often to read over <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 24, 25, 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and beg of God to help you to understand them; and fall not
<pb facs="tcp:170314:6"/> out with God and his holy Word.</p>
            <p>And give me leave to lay one Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, which may save you from all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Impenitency, if from the (real or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) faults of Governours, or their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Judgment from you, you should ever be tempted to justifie your sin.</p>
            <p>To resist or depose the <hi>Best Governours</hi> in all the world that have the Supremacy, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Subjects on pain of damnation. But the Best Governours in all the world that have the Supremacy, have been resisted or deposed in <hi>England:</hi> I mean, 1. Them that you called the <hi>Corrupt Majority,</hi> or an hundred fourty and three imprisoned and secluded Members of the long Parliament, who as the Majority had, you know what Power: and the remaining Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that now sit again (so many of them as are living.) 2. The Powers that were last laid by. I should with great rejoycing give a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thanks to that man, that will acquaint me of one Nation upon all the Earth, that hath Better Governours in Sovereign Power (as to Wisdome and Holiness conjunct) than those that have been resisted or deposed in <hi>England.</hi> Now if it were never so clearly proved, that Subjects may resist and depose bad Sovereigns (of which you have my judgement afterward at large; yet the <hi>Best</hi> must be obeyed and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
<pb facs="tcp:170314:6"/> for Violation, or else none at all must be obeyed and excepted: (which is an opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with humane Societies, as well as with Christianity.) If a Heathen persecuting <hi>Nero</hi> must be obeyed, not only for wrath, but for Conscience sake, and that as a Minister (or Officer) of God, then certainly the Best on Earth must be obeyed, what ever faults you can charge upon them. If any understand not the truth of the Minor, let them first consider the men resisted, their parts, and principles, and practices, and then consider their Laws and publick endeavours to attain the principal ends of Government, and then enquire into the state of the best govern'd Nations in the world, and tell me whether <hi>England</hi> under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not like to have been more happy, than any one of all the Nations. If this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince not, (and dark eyes perceive not an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse) stay till the effects of the late Eclipse do prove it in another manner.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But the best Governours may destroy the Commonwealth by a particular Act, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in may be resisted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They cannot be called the Best Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours that would destroy the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Would they have made it more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy than the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire under <hi>Nero?</hi> Or than the best Nation known this day on
<pb facs="tcp:170314:7"/> Earth? Every probable or possible danger, or every certain hurt or loss, is not the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Commonwealth. Nor are all things destructive to the Commonwealth that are judged so by dissenting Subjects. Either the Treachery and Destruction was controvertible or Notorious and past Controversie. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible, the Trustees of the Nation, and not a party of Subjects are the Judges. If No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, why is it not discerned by all others, or by the most? Not only I, but twenty for one (as I have reason to believe) throughout the Nation, of men truly fearing God, are of another mind. Subjects are not allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, when ever they are confident that Rulers would destroy the Commonwealth? much less when they would but cross them in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or hurt them in their personal Interests; And least of all may they depose their Rulers.</p>
            <p>O <hi>England!</hi> Hast thou forgot the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes! Hast thou no compassionate thoughts of the Nations of the Earth? Among whom the Power of Godliness is so rare? Shall the best of Governours, the greatest of Mercies, seem intollerable? Oh how happy would the best of the Nations under Heaven be, if they had the Rulers that our Ingratitude hath cast off?</p>
            <p>Forbearing therefore such Reproofs as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you cannot bear, will you bear with me,
<pb facs="tcp:170314:7"/> while I presume to <hi>wish</hi> for these <hi>few things,</hi> for the prevention of much worse to us and you: 1. I wish you may be tender of your Bretherens Consciences, and while Oaths or Engagements are doubtful to them in these unsetled times, that they may not become snares, either to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Ministers or People: Let not men too hastily be forced to engage to a Power that about a Moneth ago, it would have been judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Treason to acknowledg! Ungodly men of seared Consciences, will engage to any thing for their worldly ends! If you would not take in those into your trust, and shut out them that fear an Oath, or the violating of a Promise, then be not too forward with such Impositions. You know what Changes of the Government we have lately seen, since things were taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hands: such as I never read of before. Our old Constitution was King, Lords and Commons, which we were sworn, and sworn, and sworn again to be faithfull to, and to defend: The King withdrawing, the Lords and Commons ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alone, though they attempted not the change of the <hi>Species</hi> of Government. Next this we had the <hi>Minor</hi> part of the House of Commons in the exercise of Sovereign Power, the corrupt <hi>Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as you called them, being cast out: and by them we had the Government changed, Regality and a House of Lords being cast off. Next this we
<pb facs="tcp:170314:8"/> had nothing visible, but a Generall and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Next this we had all the whole <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the Commonwealth at once subverted: Certain men being called by the name of a Parliament, and the Sovereign Power pretended to be given them, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by them, that never were chosen by the People, but by we know not whom (such a fact as I never heard or read that any King in <hi>England</hi> was guilty of, since Parliaments were known.) Next this, we had a Protector go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning according to an Instrument, made by God knows who. After this we had a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Governing according to the Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and advice: (and sworn to both.) And now we are wheel'd about again. And would you have had all the Nation sworn or engaged to all these various forms, and that so suddenly, before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey can feel well where they stand? Should you have desired us all to engage to that which you now disclaim your selves, and to have followed you so farre in that which you now Repent of as your sinne? The case is weighty! Incomperably beyond the Estates or Lives of particular men. Should we change so rashly, and continue in it six years impenitently, and then come off again, and say, <hi>We followed the Imaginations of our own hearts,</hi> what would you judge of us for our sinne, and for our lying
<pb facs="tcp:170314:8"/> in it so long? And what a <hi>miserable Nation</hi> would so <hi>guilty a Nation</hi> be? Verily if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is such a thing as Godliness and Conscience in us, you cannot expect in such quick and frequent turns as these, that all that love their souls should follow you. Especially when you are publishing your long mistakes; which should make you fearfull of forcing us to follow you again, and us to be your hasty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. They that have been deceived, and so deceived, and so long deceived, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in it, and so angry with them that told them of it, may be deceived again for ought we know. Should we be called to as frequent Engagements as you have made mutations in the Government, were it not the way to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish conscience out of the Land, and to teach men to swallow any thing that is offered, and to sinne till they believe that nothing is a sinne?</p>
            <p>And consider how Ministers especially are dealt with. The Pamphlets that flatter you tell the world, that the Ministers no doubt will follow you any whether, and will alwaies be on the stronger side: yet others, (if not the same) proclaim, that we are seditious, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and unworthy of Protection, because we do in some things dissent. And thus they have laid such a snare for our teputations with
<pb facs="tcp:170314:9"/> you, that no man living can avoid. For we must assent or dissent, obey or disobey. If we follow you, we are called, base temporizers that love our bellys and Benefices better than our consciences. If we do not, we are called seditious, turbulent, Traytours, and what such tongues shall please. And this by men that heve seemed Religious, and forget what pathes themselves have trod. But man is not our finall Judge: We wait for his appearance that will pass the finall righteous sentence upon them and us.</p>
            <p>Much less should it ever enter into your thoughts to require others, to <hi>justifie your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actions.</hi> While you are bewailing part your selves, enforce not others to justifie the rest. Even where Christianity is unknown, such a thing would be abhorred. Every man hath a soul to save or lose; and a conscience of his own, which will accuse him, for his own transgressions, and not for other mens. If your Works have been good, the Reward will be your own; and if you force men to own them, it will not procure them your Reward: If they do prove evill, why should the Nation, or any one that did not commit them, be drawn into the guilt! If you have saved a mans life, or saved the Nation, and I had no hand in it, would you not bear with my unhappy folly, if
<pb facs="tcp:170314:9"/> I glory that I had no hand in it, and say, It was no deed of mine? If you had destroyed a mans life, what reason had I another to subscribe to it? Our Justification of your actions, is no Justification at the Barre of God, or of any well-informed conscience. Take heed of such Impositions, that more cruelly invade the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mens consciences than sober Turks or Heathens do attempt. What consciences would you bring before the Lord, and what Names would you leave to all Generations, if you should do such things as these, that have gone so farre, and ventured more than many lives, for Liberty of conscience? You know that honest men will not go against their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, what ever it cost them, when others will: And therefore unnecessary Engagements will strengthen the unconscionable, and engage you in a persecution of the best, and who will have the worst of that at last? Our quietnesse under the Lord Protector is much to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to his prudent shunning such engagements. The world is not so simple, but they can see what is aimed at, when unnecessary snares are laid before us. And no Army is so strong, or sure, but that an Army of the Prayers of persecuted Innocents may overcome them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My second wish, is, That whatever be
<pb facs="tcp:170314:10"/> our difference in smaller things, you would prove true to the Interest of Christ in the Main, and not be ensnared by the masked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels or Papists of these times, to side with them against your Brethren, that are nearer to you. Do good if you would be esteemed good. He knoweth not Christianity, that doth not know, that the Interest of Christ doth much consist in the HOLINESSE and CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORD of his Servants: and therefore in a HOLY and CONCORDANT MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTRY: And in the restraint of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing enemies of Christ. If we see once the Doctrines of <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> propogated (under what Name we do not much regard,) and the able, holy, concordant Ministry, begin to be undetermined, we shall soon know what you mean by it, and what it is that you are about. And if Gods Elect shall be put to cry to him night and day, will he not avenge them though he long delay? I tell you he <hi>will avenge them speedily,</hi> Luk. 18. 6, 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third wish is but that our Parliaments may be Holy, and this ascertained from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Generation, by such a necessary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of Elections, as I have after here at large described: that all those that by wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse have forfeited their Liberties, may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>choose</hi> nor be <hi>chosen:</hi> but yet no Faction
<pb facs="tcp:170314:10"/> exalt themselves, and oppresse their Brethren on this pretence: that so both <hi>Promiscuous</hi> and <hi>Partiall</hi> Elections may be avoided, and we may become a Holy Nation, and a Kingdom of the Lord and of his Christ. And that none of the chosen Trustees of the People, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their freedom at their entrance, by unnecessary Engagements; but if they find it needfull to the Nations good to restore a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated-well limited Prince, they may be as free as those of the contrary opinion.</p>
            <p>If Honesty and Godlinesse be the things you aim at, you will find my Principles suited to your ends: And as I like not the Democratick formes, so am I not fond of any other, above the rest. That a succession of wife and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men may be secured to the Nation in the Highest Power, is that which I have directed you the surest way to, in this Book, which if you will read, perhaps you may see the errour of those Principles, which have led you into Errours of Practice. I wrote it purposely for the use of the multitude of well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are tempted in these times to usurpe Authority, and meddle with Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have any call from God, or tollerable understanding of its Principles. I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for learned men that are verst in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks; but for such as will be Practitioners
<pb facs="tcp:170314:11"/> before they have been Students. An imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reading I think may satisfie you, that neither the <hi>People as such,</hi> nor the <hi>Godly as such,</hi> are the <hi>Original</hi> of Authority, but that it must come from the Universal Sovereign; and I have shewed you the stream of its deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I had thought here to have added some more Arguments against the <hi>Peoples</hi> being the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of <hi>Power.</hi> As 1. Governing Power must be exercised in the Name of God: Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are his Officers. But the People have no such celestial Power as to grant Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the Name of God. They may <hi>choose</hi> or <hi>nominate</hi> the <hi>Person,</hi> but <hi>give not</hi> the <hi>Power.</hi> Our Charter enbleth the Burgesses to choose their Bayliff: but he is ridiculously ignorant, that will hence conclude, that the people or Burgesses are the Original, of his Power; or that know not that they never had it, but that it flows immediately from the Charter as the Instrument of the Sovereign who is the Giver of it. So whether Princes, Lords or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be Sovereigns, the People may choose or nominate the Persons, but the Charter of the universal King (in the Law of Nature or Scripture) is the immediate Instrument of the Authority, as being the act of that will of God which doth convey it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:170314:11"/>2. If the People be naturally the Subject or Original of Sovereign Authority, then they must or may exercise that Authority themselves without Electing others to do it: But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is false: the people may not exercise it (ordinarily) themselves. For every man knows that it is monstrous confusion, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impossible. How can the people of <hi>France, Spain, Hungary, Brittaine,</hi> much lesse of the Turkish Empire, all leave their Houses and Employments, and meet together to make Laws, where the Assemblies may consist of so many millions as cannot possibly consult. He seems distracted that is for such distracted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>If you Object, <hi>That the Romane People did personally Resolve, and so did Exercise their Sovereign Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer: No plainer Instance can be given to disprove your Doctrine. The Romane Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens were a small Portion of the People of the Romane Empire. Did all the People of the Empire ever meet to Resolve on Laws? Or dare you say that <hi>Naturally</hi> the Inhabitants or Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> alone were born the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Power, and Governours of the rest of the world? What difference between <hi>their Natural Right,</hi> and other mens?</p>
            <p>And that the consequence is valid, (that the
<pb facs="tcp:170314:12"/> People may exercise the Power themselves if they have it) is evident from the true nature of this Power. For it is an <hi>Office Power</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, and consisteth essentially in two parts: 1. An <hi>Obligation</hi> to Govern, making it a Duty. 2. A <hi>Right to Govern,</hi> warranting the Performance. Now he that is <hi>Obliged</hi> to <hi>Govern,</hi> sinneth if he do not; and he that hath a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Govern,</hi> may justly himself Govern. I confesse, in many other cases, a man may have a thing to <hi>Give,</hi> which he hath not to <hi>Use:</hi> But it cannot be so here, because the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing is referred immediately to <hi>Use. Governing</hi> is the <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Power:</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> in question is a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Govern;</hi> and not only to choose a Governour; for that we are agreed of: and I will not suppose the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er so ignorant, as not to see a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Power to Rule,</hi> and a <hi>Power to Choose Rulers.</hi> (Popular Church Government is also concerned in the decision.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the people are naturally the Sovereign <hi>Power,</hi> then it is either <hi>All</hi> or <hi>Part:</hi> But neither <hi>All,</hi> nor <hi>Part,</hi> therefore. 1. It cannot be <hi>All</hi> conjunctly: because where all Govern, none are Governed; and so there being no Subjects, there can be no Sovereign: Nor can any be punished against his will, because the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor is One of the All. Nor was ever such
<pb facs="tcp:170314:12"/> a thing yet existent in the world, as a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exercised by All the People: it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. If you say, It shall be exercised by a <hi>Part,</hi> then it is not the <hi>People,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> that <hi>Part of the People,</hi> that have the Power: It is plain, therefore that it is not <hi>Naturally</hi> in the <hi>People as such;</hi> for the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Part</hi> that Governeth is the same with the rest. Either the <hi>Governing Part</hi> is <hi>statedly</hi> determinate, or only <hi>temporarily.</hi> If statedly determinate, (as is a Senate, a Parliament, Lords, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> this is but a <hi>Part</hi> elected by the People; and as <hi>Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a <hi>Governour,</hi> is not <hi>Governing;</hi> so a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Electing is not a Power of Governing. If the Ruling <hi>Part</hi> be <hi>temporarily determinate,</hi> (as is a Major Vote of the People themselves) this also must come but from the Election of the People: for by Nature an hundred and one are not the Governours of Ninety nine: or if they <hi>were, that</hi> would prove it but in <hi>Part</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Whoever therefore the People choose, whether King, Lords, Senates, Parliaments, or their own Major Part, it is but a <hi>Power of choose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Persons</hi> that they have, and not a <hi>Power of Governing.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap> believing the Power to be in the People; I would their part without violation might have rested in them whom the People
<pb facs="tcp:170314:13"/> Chose. But when I remember and look about me upon the present face of things, I am not in much <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>Popular Power,</hi> or <hi>Liberty either,</hi> for full and free Elections. Though the name do ring so much in my ears, and Mr. <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> may think his work begun, I never lesse fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a free Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>But there are two other Opinions, that have as much need of Confutation. <hi>One is, Whether the strength and Authority be not the same, and that strongest have not Right to Govern?</hi> But the Brutishnesse of the Affirmative I have after manifested. Then it would follow that a Thief or Pirate wants nothing but strength to justifie his actions, even before God. And that the Army is to Command the Generall, and the Common Souldiers must rule their Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and Captains because they are the stronger, and can master them if they will: And that no People are to be Ruled by ther Prince or Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, because they are the stronger. And that the Servants must command their Masters (if he have not an assistant strength,) and the Children when grown up must Rule the Aged Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But wee'l leave this Authority which consists in strength to ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against the Lord and all just Power.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>Doubt</hi> with some is, <hi>Whether Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:170314:13"/> be not Authority, and the Saints the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rulers of the World?</hi> This also I have after Answered. 1. If all Saints be Governours, then all the Subjects must be wicked; and then all Commonwealths must be wicked. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very soul is commanded to be subject to the Highest Powers; even the <hi>Godly</hi> to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> and that not only for fear of wrath, but for Conscience sake, because they are Ministers, that is Officers of God. 3. <hi>The Godly</hi> must <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> all others in Obedience; and be so far from aspiring after Government, that they must take it for their greatnesse to be the Servants of all; and must sit down at the lower end, and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and not exalt themselves, but imitate Christ in lowliness and meekness, that in his state of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, saith, his <hi>Kingdom was not of this world,</hi> and asketh, <hi>who made him a Judge; or divider of Inheritances?</hi> and himself paid Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Money to Heathen Governours. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth doubly dispose and oblige us to obey: And the Godly must eminently excell all others in their Obedience. Even the <hi>chosen Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Royal Priesthood, the holy Nation, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People are commanded to submit themselves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Governours, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the
<pb facs="tcp:170314:14"/> praise of them that do well: For so is the will of God, that with well doing, we may put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ignorance of foolish men. Servants must be subject to their Masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but to the froward,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9, 13, 14, 15, 18. see more in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1, to 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Col. 3. 22, to the end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. and Epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> &amp;c. To allow men to Rebell or resist Authority, because they are Godly (though their Rulers be ungodly) is to allow them to be <hi>ungodly</hi> or disobedient to God, because they are Godly: A palpable contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The predictions of the Power of the Saints do warrant none to usurpe a Power: no more then the prediction that the Kings of the Earth shall give up their Power to the Beasts, doth warrant them to do it. Predictions make not Duty, but Precepts; and Promises will not serve instead of Commissions or Donations, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to seize on the thing promised, before it's given to us. Nor doth the prediction or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it self intend that Godlinesse shall be any mans Title to Government. For then (still) the Subjects must be all ungodly. Pride and not Godlinesse breeds the Vermine of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious conceits, through the power of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Prince of Pride, and the Sun shine of Victory and prosperity, requiting God with Evil for Good.</p>

            <p>But if now it be in the hearts of any to set up a party (or all the shreds of the Dividers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned) instead of all that fear the Lord, and to cry up themselves as the Godly Party, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their Brethren, and captivate those that are better then themselves.

            <head>An Addition to the Preface, being a Discussion of the Answer to the Healing Question.</head>
            <p>BEcause it is a matter of so great moment, that you pass not in impenitency to the Barre of God, (where you must all spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily appear) and that the many Thousands of this Nation, that never were actually guilty, may not make your sinnes (sinnes of such a dreadfull nature) to become their own by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; I thought it my duty to manifest the fallacy of all those Arguments, which I judged might most probably deceive you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore supposing that thence you are likely to fetch matter of encouragement, I shall briefly discuss the wounding <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Healing Question,</hi> so far as may concern your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He placeth the <hi>Cause</hi> in two things; 1 <hi>p.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>To have and enjoy the Freedom (by way of dutifull compliance and candescension from all the parts and members of this society,) to set up meet persons in the place of Supream Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and authority amongst them.</hi> 2. p. 5, 6. <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in matters of Religion, or that concern the service and worship of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170314:18"/>
            <p>The former is thus enlarged, <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>That the body of the good people in their military capacity and posture, are most properly Soveraign, and possesse their right of naturall Soveraignty.]</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>[Becoming one Civill or Politick Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the whole Party of honest Men, they do therein keep the Soveraignty, as Originally seated in themselves, and part with it only as by way of Deputation, and Representation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>The second <hi>(Religious Liberty,)</hi> is <hi>(p.</hi> 5, 6, 7.) said to be that <hi>[which the Nations of the world have right and title to by the purchase of Christs blood, who by virtue of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, is become the sole Lord and Ruler in and over the Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that every one might give an account of himself in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gods Worship unto God and Christ alone, as their own Master unto whom they stand or fall in Judgment, and are not in these things to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, or brought before the judgment Seats of Men. For why shouldst thou set at naught thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the matters of his Faith and Conscience. and herein intrude into the proper Office of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By virtue of this Supream Law Sealed and Confirmed in the Blood of Christ to all Men, it is, that all Magistrates are to fear and forbear intermedling with giving Rule or interposing in those matters.—He is to be a Minister of Terror
<pb facs="tcp:170314:18"/> and Revenge to those that do evil in matters of outward practice, converse, and dealings in the things of this life between man and man, for the cause whereof the Judicatures of men are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and set up. To exeeed these limits is not safe,</hi> &amp;c.] And <hi>p.</hi> 7. he would have) <hi>this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint laid on the Supream Power, before it be erected, as a Fundamentall Constitution among others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that it be acknowledged the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act of the Ruling Power, when once brought into a capacity of acting Legislatively, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are bound up, and judge it their duty so to be, both in reference to God, the Institutour of Magistracy, and in reference to the whole body,</hi> &amp;c.] So much of the Cause.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Persons that he supposeth have this <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> are sometimes said to be <hi>[the Nations of the world]</hi> and <hi>[all men whose souls Christ challenges a propriety in, to bring under his inward Rule in the service and worship of God,]</hi> &amp;c. And the ground of it is made to be <hi>Nature</hi> it self, sometimes it is <hi>[The whole party of Honest Men adhearing to this Cause,</hi> p. 3. <hi>[And their right is double, 1. Naturall, 2. By the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their Armes, this is restored:] [They have added to the naturall right which was in them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the right of Conquest,</hi> p. 2. sometimes it is <hi>the whole body of the People,</hi> that the right and freedom was, and is due to, <hi>p.</hi> 4.] sometimes
<pb facs="tcp:170314:19"/>
               <hi>[the actions proceeding from hearts sincerely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the Cause, created in them a right, to be of an Incorporation and society by themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Good Party.—These in Order to the maintaining of this Cause have stood by the Army, in defence and support thereof, against all opposition whatever, as those that by the growing light of these times, have been taught and led forth in their experiences, to look above and beyond the Letter, form, and outward circumstances of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, into the inward reason and spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, herein only to fix and terminate,</hi> &amp;c.] p. 9. <hi>It is [the whole Body of the adherents to this Cause,] that in the several parts of the Nations, that must choose a General Council or Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faithfull Honest and discerning Men,</hi> p. 20.]</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lastly, <hi>The capacities wherein the persons then qualified have acted, have been very variable.—And very seldom, if ever at all so exactly, and in all points consonant to the Rule of former Laws and Constitutions of Government, as to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully justified by them, any longer than the Law of successe and Conquest did uphold them, who had the inward warrant of Justice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, to encourage them in such their actings. The utmost and last reserve which they have had, in case all other failed, hath been their military ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; not only strictly taken for the standing
<pb facs="tcp:170314:19"/> Army, but in the largest sense, wherein the whole Party may (with the Army,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>associate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pretend not to an infallibility in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of these words; but that they may do your Consciences no harm, I shall first tell you what we Grant, and secondly wherein we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from what doth seem to be here expressed and emplyed, and the reasons of this dissent shall be annexed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We Grant that the Peoples Consent is ordinarily necessary to the constitution of the Government, and that their freedom is taken from them, when this is denied them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We believe that notorious wickednesse, and divers particular crimes, may forfeit this Freedom as to particular persons: And if the design of this Honourable Writer were, that <hi>all Honest men indeed without partiality and division,</hi> might have the liberty of choosing and being chosen, and none shut out, but those that are proved to have forfeited their liberty; we should concurre with great alacrity and joy (so be it, that oppression make not those scruples or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of judgment to seem a forfeiture of our liberty, which are not.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. We Grant that the Consciences of men are out of the reach of the Magistrates judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; further then they are manifested by their
<pb facs="tcp:170314:20"/> Words or Deeds: And we grant that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Peace of the Church, must not be laid on lower Controversies, but on the Essentials of Religion, even of Faith and Communion: and that we must tolerate all tolerable differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among honest men: In well doing all men should be encouraged, In ill doing through mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, well meaning men must be tolerated, as far as Charity to Church and State, and to their own and others souls will bear it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We believe that a Prudent Godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, is so exceeding great a blessing to the Nation, (above any forms in wicked hands) that all lawfull means should be used to procure and secure it to us and our posterity.</p>
            <p>But yet these following Propositions I shall manifest to be most certain truths.</p>
            <p>Prop. 1. <hi>The free Choice of Parliament men was a thing that on all hands was granted to be our due, and therefore could not be the Cause of the Warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King granted it; and all Parties in our latter Divisions do assert it: so that it cannot be the matter of any <hi>New Cause</hi> neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know not of any Adversaries that it hath considerable among us, unlesse those that chose the Little-nominall Parliament. Indeed by the Disuse of Parliaments, our Rights were violated: but the Peoples Right to a free Choice was still acknowledged.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170314:20"/>
            <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That the People had right to choose a House of Commons, that should have the whole Soveraignty, or the whole Legislative Power, was none of the Old Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. No such thing was Asserted and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Parliament, when the Cause was stated, and the War begun. 2. They profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the contrary in their Declarations of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and in their Laws, which were Enacted by Authority of the King and Lords, as well as of the Commons. Read them, and this will be past all doubt. 3. And the Protestations and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant confirm it.</p>
            <p>Prop. 3. <hi>It was none of the Old Cause, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert any proper Soveraignty in the People, either as People, or as Godly People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. No such thing was declared. 2. The Soveraignty was stated elsewhere. 3. It was only the Rights and Liberties of the People, and not their Soveraignty that was Declared for.</p>
            <p>Prop. 4. <hi>It was none of the Cause of our Warre, to change the Constitution of the Common wealth, into any other form than we found it in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To assert, this were to lay all the guilt of the blood a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> miseries of the Nation, undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly upon the Parliament, and to proclaim us all Rebels, that adhered to them. For it is past doubt, that the Soveraignty being mixt or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
<pb facs="tcp:170314:21"/> into the hands of King, Lords, and Commons, no part had Authority to change the Constitution. 2. On the contrary it was the <hi>Preserving</hi> of the <hi>Fundamentall Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that the Parliament Declared for. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for the Person and Authority of the King, and for the Power and Priviledges of Parliaments, of which the Lords were part and Authors of those Declarations. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an injury of the highest Nature, against the Honour of the Parliament, the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and the Protestant Religion; if any should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they raised a War to change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and overthrow the Fundamentall Constitution, and that when they swore us to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Prop. 5. <hi>The Remonstrance of the Kingdom; the Declaration of the Lords and Commons of</hi> Aug. 3. 1642. <hi>setting forth the Grounds and Reasons that necessitate them at this time to take up Defensive Arms for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majesties Person, the maintenance of the true Religion, the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, and the Power and Priviledges of Parliament; also the Propositions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of</hi> June 10. 1642. <hi>for brin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>g in Money and Plate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to maintain the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Kings Authority, his Person in his Royal dignity, the free Course of Justice, the Laws of
<pb facs="tcp:170314:21"/> the Land, the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Priviledges of Parliament against any force that shall oppose them: I say these Declarations, with two Protestations, and the solemn Vow and Covenant, do fully declare what was the Old Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though no man have more reason to know it then the Honourable Author of the <hi>Healing Question,</hi> yet no Evidences can so fully Declare it to us, as these Declarations and Protestations which were purposed to that use.</p>
            <p>Prop. 6. <hi>It was none of the Old Cause that the People should have Liberty, and the Magistrate should have no Power in all matters of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Faith and Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of the Honourable Author I have recited before, without any exception, restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or limitation, that I can find, he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extendeth the Case to, <hi>[Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that concern the Service and Worship of God,]</hi> p. 5. and to <hi>[matters of Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,]</hi> and <hi>[All matters of Gods Worship,]</hi> p. 6. of which he saith, <hi>We must give account of our selves unto God and Christ alone,</hi> and that <hi>[all Magistrates must fear and forbear inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling with▪]</hi> Now that this discharging the Magistrate from his Duty, or this disabling him, or stating of his Power, and this extended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in All matters of Worship, Faith, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="tcp:170314:22"/> was none of the <hi>Old Cause,</hi> nor is any <hi>Good Cause,</hi> I shall prove but briefly (yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently) here, as intending, if God will, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of that point alone.</p>
            <p>But still remember that it is no Controversie among us, 1. Whether men should have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for <hi>True</hi> Religion, true Faith, and true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God? For these should have more than <hi>Liberty.</hi> But whether, there should be Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for false Religion, false Faith, and false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, if the persons do but think them true? And whether the reason of this Liberty be, that the Magistrate hath not here to do? 2. Nor is it any Controversie among us, whether the Magistrate can judg of Inward Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science immediately? or whether he should compell men to Believe? or yet to professe that they do believe when they do not? It is a work that is beyond his power to compell men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: else Charity would require him to do it. And we are far from thinking that he should compell them to lye and dissemble a Faith which they have not. But the Question is, Whether he may restrain them from publique practising false Worship, and propagating a false Faith or Infidelity, and from drawing others to their mind and way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The toleration of Popery, by too much connivance, and the increase of Popery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb facs="tcp:170314:22"/> was one of the great offences and grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that this (and former) Parliaments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of and Declared against in their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances, therefore that Popery should be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or that none but Christ should judg men in all matters of Worship, or of Faith, was none of the Old Cause that was owned by that Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, but the clean contrary. It was liberty for Popery, that was their great offence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The same Parliament made it the <hi>Old Cause,</hi> to Defend the Protestant Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that would undermine it by the foresaid encouragement of Popery: therefore they never made it the <hi>(Old Cause,)</hi> to disown their power in matters of Religion, and to give liberty for all Religions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The said Parliament made it a part of their complaints, that the Masse was so openly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at the Queens Chappell, and so many permitted to come to it, therefore they took not liberty for the Masse, to be the <hi>Cause</hi> they fought for. I marvaile how it would have been interpreted, in the beginning or midst of the first War, if any in the Parliament had said, We fight for Liberty for the Mass, and to maintain that we have no power to hinder it, nor in any matters of Faith and Worship.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The same Parliament (that are the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Old Cause,) did put the Articles of
<pb facs="tcp:170314:23"/> Religion (and that not for an Universal Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but for establishing the Protestant Cause) into all their <hi>Treaties</hi> with the King: and insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them above all: therefore they made it not their Cause to give liberty to the Mass, or to disclaim any power about the matters of Faith and Worship.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The same Parliament calling an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, Authorized them but to Advise them, and that only about such matters as they should propose to them themselves: And they debated all that was propounded to them; and passed what they saw meet: therefore it was none of their Old Cause, that Magistrates have nothing to do in these things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The same Parliament setled the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government by many Ordinances: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought they had power in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The same Parliament past an Ordinance against Heresies and Blaspheming; Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting divers that are against Faith and Worship: therefore it was none of their Old Cause to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert a liberty in such things, and to disclaim a power to restrain them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The same Parliament made Laws against Popery, and put an Oath of Abjuration on them, and executed the Ancient Laws against them: therefore they did not fight for Liberty for the Mass.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb facs="tcp:170314:23"/>9. The same Parliament made it their great Argument and Advantage against the King, that he favoured the Papists, and intended them a Toleration or Connivance: And on this supposition they had thousands that came in to fight for their Cause: therefore they made it not their Cause to fight for Liberty of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, or of Popery alone.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The same Parliament solemnly swore themselves, and engaged the Nation in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations and a Covenant, <hi>to defend the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, and to endeavour the Reformation of Religion in Doctrine, Discipline, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and Government, and to bring the Church in the three Kingdomes to the nearest Conjunction and Uniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. With much more that shews, that they made it not the cause of their War to prove that they had no power in these matters.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The same Parliament displaced many in the Universities, upon the account of matters of Religion, and they cast out abundance of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters upon the same account: therefore it was not the cause of their War to prove that they had no power in these things.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The same Parliament accused and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to alter Religion, and introduce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery by befriending it: And <hi>Windebanke</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:170314:24"/> others were accused for befriending Priests and Jesuites: therefore they took it not to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beyond their power or duty to meddle in these things, nor was liberty for Popery the Old Cause.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as it is not the <hi>Old Cause,</hi> so it is not a <hi>Good Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. It contradicteth the expresse revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will of God, in the holy Scriptures. <hi>Moses</hi> had to do in matters of Religion as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate; and so had the Ruling Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> that assisted him: And so had the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Juda,</hi> as is well known. Insomuch that in <hi>Asa</hi>'s daies they covenanted to put him to death that would not seek the Lord God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But of this more in due place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It tendeth to the ruine of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and therefore it is no good Cause. How God was provoked by <hi>Aarons</hi> Calf, and by his Sons, that offered strange fire which the Lord commanded not, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. and what was the effect, and what benefit the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> brought to <hi>Israel</hi> and to <hi>Jereboams</hi> House, and the High places, and other errours about Worship, brought to the Princes and People of <hi>Juda,</hi> we need not particularly recite. Law and Providence are quite changed, if To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of false Worship and other abuses of Religion, tend not to the ruine of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:170314:24"/>3. That is no good Cause that vilifieth the Magistrate, and teacheth the People so to do, and sets up the Ministers of the Gospel above him, more than a Prince in worldly splendor is above a Slave. But such is the Cause that I am now opposing. The matters of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, of Faith and Religion, are more above the matters of this world, than that comes to. If Magistrates be once taken to be such terrestriall Creatures, as that their businesse is only about these vile corporeall things, their office will be esteemed of, no better than the Object of it, or the work in which they are imployed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Decalogue was the Vitall part of the <hi>Jews</hi> Political Laws, and every Commandement of the first Table was seconded with a Penall Sanction: therefore these things belong to the Magistrate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That is not the <hi>Good Cause</hi> that tendeth directly to the destruction of Faith and Piety, and the Everlasting damnation of mens souls: But such is this of Libertinism which we oppose: For, Popery, Mahometanism, In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idelity, and Heathenism, are the way to Damnation: But Liberty to preach up and to practice them, is the means to make men Papists, Mahometans, Infidels, and Heathens; therefore this Liberty is the way to mens damnation.</p>
            <p>It's well known by experience, how ready
<pb facs="tcp:170314:25"/> the multitude of ignorant, unsetled and proud people are to be led into any damning course, if they be dealt with by men of voluble tongues, and that come with any advantages to deceive them. A man that will deny the life to come, or revile Christ and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or teach men to worship <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or the Sunne and Moon, if he have liberty, and a plausible tongue, may look to have Disciples. The preaching of falsehood hath as true a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to damn men, as the preaching of truth hath to save them. None can be wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills: He that will bring men to damnation, must do it by deceiving them, and enticing them thither: They that most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote mens delusion in the matters of Faith and Holy practice, do most promote their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And how deadly an enemy contention is to charity and holy living, and how certainly the Liberty in question will kndle continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, is a thing too evident to need proof.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That's not a good Cause that gratifieth Satan, and promoteth his Kingdom, and his malicious ends: But so doth the Liberty now in question: For it is <hi>his Liberty,</hi> to deceive by his Instruments, and so to damn as many as he can. When he is let loose to deceive them that
<pb facs="tcp:170314:25"/> dwell on the Earth, it is saddest with the Church; <hi>Satans Liberty to deceive,</hi> is not the <hi>Churches Liberty,</hi> nor purchased by Christ for us, but is a heavy judgment. As Christ teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and saveth by his Ministers and Doctrine, and hath liberty when his Word doth run and hath its liberty; so Satan teacheth and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his Instruments and Doctrine, and hath liberty when they have liberty.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We must pray for our selves and others, that <hi>[we be not led into temptation:]</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a <hi>good Cause</hi> to let loose Tempters by a Law, or to permit men to exercise their wit and eloquence and other faculties, to draw as many as they can to sinne; even to those sinnes that have the strongest tendency to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If Magistrates must give Liberty for all to propogate a false Religion, then so must Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Masters also: (For their coercive Power is rather lesse then the Magistrates then more; and they are no more Lords of Faith or Conscience.) But if all Parents and Masters should give such liberty, it would be a crime so horrid in the nature and effects, as I am loath to name with its proper titles.</p>

            <p n="10">10. The particular Churches by the Power that Christ hath given them in the Gospel, may judg men for Heresie and false worship; and must not give such liberty. <hi>Tit. 3. 10, 11. A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second admonition reject: Knowing that he that is such, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</hi> 2 Joh. 10. <hi>If there come any to you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your house, neither bid him, God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evil deeds.</hi> Rev. 2. 14, 15, 20. <hi>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the Doctrine of Balaam—So hast thou also them that hold the Doctrine of the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
<pb facs="tcp:170314:27"/> which thing I hate—Because thou sufferest that woman Jezabel, which calleth her self a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse, to teach and to seduce my Servants, to commit fornication, and to eat things offered to Idols. Elymas</hi> was struck blind for resisting the Gospel; and this (though miraculously) by the Ministry of the Apostle. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were slain for thinking to deceive the Holy Ghost. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> feared such a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for such another sinne: <hi>Paul</hi> wisht them cut off that troubled the <hi>Galatians.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Blasphemers up to <hi>Satan.</hi> All this shews that it is not true, that <hi>Christ only is to judge</hi> such Errours, or that we are to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him alone.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is expressly <hi>[the judgment seats of men]</hi> that by the Authour is contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished to the <hi>judgment of Christ:</hi> And the Church, both Pastours and People are men, as well as the Magistrate. 2.

<pb facs="tcp:170314:28"/> may produce to the setting up of the Lord himself, and chief Judge and Lawgiver among us.]</hi> Now either he meaneth that Christ <hi>immediately</hi> by himself shall be the Judge, or <hi>mediately by his Officers</hi> The first cannot be his sense, as I have many reasons to believe. And if it be <hi>Christ by his Officers,</hi> then either by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Officers,</hi> or <hi>Church-Officers.</hi> The first cannot rationally be judged to be his sense: For a <hi>Holy Magistrate</hi> is supposed to be the <hi>Means</hi> to bring in Christ as Judge: and the Means and End are not the same. And if it be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christs by <hi>Church-Officers,</hi> that is intended, I know not in particular what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For if neither the Government by Bishops, Presbyters, People, or all conjunct, or any that we have had in <hi>England,</hi> be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ, I know not what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by man we can expect that is truly his: And therefore if we have not the Government of Christ already, I despair of having it (Though I hope we may have it better exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by his Officers.) For I dare confidently say, that the <hi>Government by the Romane Vice-Christ, is none of the Government of Christ that we should hope for, and that I have proved it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is my Argument: If the Legislati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Judgment by Jesus Christ among us be
<pb facs="tcp:170314:29"/> the End that our Government should aim at, then the liberty in all matters of Worship, and of Faith, is not the Good Cause; for this is against, and most inconsistent with this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ. I appeal to Reason, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give men liberty to preach down Christ as a deceiver, to preach up <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Sun or Moon, to deny the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or perswade men that there is no life but this, no Heaven or Hell, and to cry down Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a holy life, and all actual worship of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, whether liberty for these (yea or the Masse alone) be liker to be the Government of Jesus Christ, or conducing to it, then is the restraint of all this Infidelity and impiety? Doth Christ rule more when all we have leave to spit at his Name, and call him <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and to deny his Faith and Worship, then where none are suffered to do this? This will be believed but by few that consider of it. At least when a Christian that's now deluded with the specious name of <hi>Religious Liberty,</hi> should see the practice, and hear his Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled by the Jews, and the Mahometans, and the wicked heardened in their sinne, by being told that there is no life but this, it would make his heart to turn and tremble, and then he would say, that this Liberty signifieth the Reign of Satan, and not of Christ; and that it is the
<pb facs="tcp:170314:29"/> loosing of the Dragon, and not the liberty of the Saints. It's an unholy Saint that would have liberty to reproach his Lord, or deny the Faith, or any Essential Article of it, or to speak against his holy Worship.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Liberty in all matters of Worship and of Faith, is the open and apparent way to set up Popery in the Land: Therefore it is not the Good Cause.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent hath such evidence, that it would be injurious to a <hi>wise mans</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to suppose that he doth not see it (that Popery were thus likely to be set up.) And he that seeth it, and yet would effect it.—</p>
            <p>Consider 1. How sutable Popery is to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inclination, (as I have manifested elsewhere.) 2. What plausible Reasons Papists have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude poor souls, from pretended Universality, Antiquity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. And how few of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are able to defend their Faith, or to answer the two great Sophisticall Questions of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, <hi>Where hath your Church been Visible in all Ages?</hi> and, <hi>How prove you the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi> 4. And how it will take with the People to be told that their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all died in the Romane Faith. 5. And above all, what a multitude of Jesuites, Fryers, and Priests can they prepare for the work, and
<pb facs="tcp:170314:30"/> pour out upon us at their pleasure, from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, France, Rome,</hi> and other places. And how these men are purposely trained up for this deceiving work, and have their common Arguments at their fingers ends; which though they are thredbare and transparent fallicies to the wise, yet to the vulgar, yea to our unstudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentry, they are as good as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been confuted, or as the best. 6. And what a world of wealth and secular help is at their becks in <hi>France, Flanders, Italy, Spain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> &amp;c. They have Millions of Gold, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies and Armies ready to promote their work, which other Sects have none of. 7. And what worldly Motives have their Priests and Fryers to promote their zeal? Their superiours have such variety of Preferments, and ample Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to reward them with, and their single life alloweth them so much vacancy from Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick avocations, and withall, they so much glory in a Pharisaicall zeal in compassing Sea and Land to make Proselytes, that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible advantage that they get by their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry: the envious man by them being sowing his tares, whilest others sleep, and are not half so industrious in resisting them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. What abundance have they lately won in <hi>England,</hi> notwithstanding they have wanted publique liberty, and have only taken secret op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb facs="tcp:170314:30"/> to seduce? Persons of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Gentry, and of the Clergy, as well as of the common people, and zealous Professors of Religion of late, as well as the prophane have been seduced by them. Princes in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have been wonne by them; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion cunningly workt out: And what a lamentable encrease they had made in <hi>England</hi> before our Warres, by that conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and favour which through the Queen was procured them, (though incomparably short of this absolute Liberty) is sufficiently known.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And it is not the least of our danger, that the most of our Ministers are unable to deal with a cunning Jesuite or Priest: And this is not to be wondered at; considering how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay of them are very young men, put in of late in the necessity of the Churches (which the world knows who have caused) and there must be time, before young men can grow to maturity, and an unfurnished Nation can be provided with able experienced men; And the cessation of Popish assaults of late, hath disused Ministers from those Disputations: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation seemed to have brought down Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery so low, that we grew secure, and thought there was no danger of it: And the Papists of late have forborn much to meddle with us
<pb facs="tcp:170314:31"/> bare-fac'd, and have plaid their game under the vizor of other Sects; and withall young godly Ministers have been so taken up with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er work of winning souls from common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse, that most have laid by their Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Arms, and are grown too much unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with these Controversies. We have so much noted how Controversie in other Countries hath eaten out much of the Power of Godlinesse, that we have fallen by disuse into an unacquaintednesse with the means of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Defence; and while we thought we might lay by our weapons, and build with both hands, we are too much unready to withstand the adversary. Alas, what work would Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for Jesuites and Fryers, make in our Congregations in a few Moneths space! I must confess this, though some will think it is our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour. It is not from any strength in their Cause (for they argue against common sense it self;) but from their carnal advantages, and our disadvantages fore-mentioned. It's easier to pull down then build; and to set a Town on fire than to re-edifie one House; and to wound than to heal.</p>

The unreasonablenesse of this will quickly procure a repeal. And how can such a Senate deny the Papists Liberty, when they plead their own Principles, yea their Fundamental Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it? It's past doubt this Doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up <hi>England</hi> to the Pope: I know Infidels, and also many tolerable Sects are all at work as well as Papists: But Infidels go against so much, so clear prevailing light, and make such a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid motion to mens souls, and the tolerable Sects are broken into so many parts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all would use us tolerably, if they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and all of them are void of those Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of Learned men, and Money, and Arms, and Power at their backs, which the Papists have, that it's easie to see that the Papists (yet smiling on the Infidel) would swallow up all.

By this Rule (of confining Power and Liberty to the owners of the fore-described Cause) the <hi>Old Parliament</hi> must be excluded from all Power and Liberty, and so made slaves: For they fully signified their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be against it: Not only in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned waies and acts, but also by Acts or Ordinances aginst <hi>prophane Swearing,</hi> and <hi>for the holy Observation of the Lords Day,</hi> and divers the like <hi>about Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And <hi>all the Parliaments</hi> that have been
<pb facs="tcp:170314:33"/> ever since (that which the people chose not, I call not a Parliament:) have all discovered their Judgments against this Cause.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So did the old Lord Protector (or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which you will) in his time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. So did all the Parliaments in King <hi>James</hi> and the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> his time, that made such ado against the connivance at, and encrease of Popery and <hi>Arminianism</hi> (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you may see in Mr. <hi>Rushworths</hi> Collections:) And were none of these fit to be exempted from slavery, and to be free men in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
            <p n="6">6. This very Parliament as it was before its dissolution, declared themselves of another mind, and medled with matters of Religion and Worship, as in many instances I can quickly prove.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Army according to this Rule, must be enslaved, and deprived of Liberty and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For they have more than once declared themselves against this Universal Liberty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. First in their <hi>Agreement of the People,</hi> and then in the <hi>Instrument of Government;</hi> and now in their <hi>Proposals to this Parliament,</hi> they exclude from <hi>Liberty, Popery, and Prelacy,</hi> and all that <hi>profess not Faith in God by Jesus Christ,</hi> or <hi>in the Trinity;</hi> and <hi>that professe not to believe the holy Scriptures.</hi> And if the Army also
<pb facs="tcp:170314:34"/> must be denied Liberty, who shall have it? when yet you describe the <hi>good Party</hi> by their adhering to the Army? <hi>Even in this cause,</hi> which the Army was against? They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for too much Liberty, but not for such a Liberty as this.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The same I may say of all those Judges and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and other persons of quality, that owned the <hi>Instrument of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Yea, I may boldly say, That it is the farre greatest part of the godly in the Land that must be disfranchized by this Rule: For the far greatest part of them abhorre the thoughts of <hi>Liberty for the Masse,</hi> and <hi>for preaching up Popery, Mahometanism or Infidelity:</hi> Most of them desired the <hi>Acts for the Lords Day,</hi> which sheweth that they are for no <hi>such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. And if it were a just and pious opinion, yet there is nothing in it, that our Liberties should lie upon. If men have a natural Right to their Liberties, as you intimate; how can it be proved that this Right is lost to all that do not thus debase the Magistrate, and are not for such extended Liberty? We may differ much more than this I hope, without forfeiting our Civil Liberties. Good men are as lyable to differ in judgment about a point in Politicks
<pb facs="tcp:170314:34"/> (which is little studied by them) as of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And in Religion it self, if other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deprive us not of Liberty, why should this only be thought sufficient. If <hi>one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not a life to come,</hi> may have Liberty, why may not one <hi>who thinks that such should not be tolerated to propagate their unbelief?</hi> Are those uncapable of Liberty in <hi>England,</hi> that have Liberty in all other Christian Commonwealths? And are those uncapable of Liberty in <hi>England</hi> now, under the intended Commonwealth, that have hitherto enjoyed it, and constituted the Commonwealth? We shall then see how Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is promoted.</p>
            <p>Prop. 8. <hi>Conquest doth give neither the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor the friends of the fore-described Cause, any Soveraignty, or Right to deprive us of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that disowns that Cause, or any Right to Rule us, or to Resist our Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I prove it thus: 1. They fought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered but in the capacity of Subjects; and therefore could win no more then the Rights of Subjects to themselves. They fought not for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to themselves, therefore they won no Soveraignty to themselves. I suppose they will not say, they fought for it; nor for more than the Securing and Improving of the Rights and Liberties which they had before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What Armies win (beside their pay and
<pb facs="tcp:170314:35"/> lawfull prize) they win for their lawfull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, under whose Authority they fight, and not for themselves. If Towns and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles won by Warre be not the Armies, but the Civil Powers under whom they serve, much lesse is Soveraignty theirs by Conquest. If any could win it by Conquest it was the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to whom the Souldiers did professe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Parliament that had a part in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty were not (justly) conquered by the Army: Therefore the Soveraignty could not be won from them by the Conquest. For the Parliament had no Warre with the Army, or none wherein the Army could have a just Cause and pretence of Conquest.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is the Peoples Right to choose their Governours.</p>
            <p>But the People of <hi>England</hi> (besides the Cavaliers) were not conquered by the Army: Therefore they have not lost their Right by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conquered, nor can be denied the exercise of it, nor can any pretend a Power of Ruling them by Conquest without their choice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we are not conquered by the Army is plain, in that we never fought against them, and therefore could not be conquered by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that many of us fought for our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as they.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170314:35"/>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But the Army were not Mercenary Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and therefore are not tied to the Laws of such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Either the meaning is, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took pay, or else that they made not their pay their ultimate end. The first will not be said or believed. The second is a secret of the Heart: but charity binds us to believe it to be true: For it is a hard Question, Whether <hi>such a mercenary Souldier</hi> that kills men meerly for eight pence, or two shillings six pence a day (or more) be not as bad as a <hi>Cannibal,</hi> that killeth them to eat. Sure we are he is unworthy the name of a Christian, if not of a man. And it's no good consequence, that men have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Soveraignty, or a Right to Resist the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, because they were not so inhumane. And yet none can speak such things certainly of any but himself, because we know not the hearts of others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But still they fought as <hi>Subjects,</hi> though not as <hi>such Mercenary Souldiers;</hi> and therefore as <hi>Subjects</hi> they were bound to continue in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for conscience sake.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If Conquest be a Title either to Rule, or risist Rulers, then it is either the <hi>General</hi> only, or the <hi>Army under him</hi> that hath won to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this Right. If the <hi>General only,</hi> then the Army are nevertheless <hi>Subjects</hi> still: If to
<pb facs="tcp:170314:36"/> the <hi>Army,</hi> then either to the <hi>Officers only,</hi> or to the <hi>common Souldiers.</hi> To the <hi>Officers only</hi> it cannot be; for the same reason that will put by the <hi>General</hi> from that Soveraign or Right, will <hi>put by them.</hi> And if it did not, how should we know whether it were <hi>All the Officers,</hi> or <hi>which of them?</hi> If it be the <hi>common Souldiers</hi> that have won the Soveraignty, and so it is in the <hi>Major</hi> Vote, why then do the Officers presume to command them? Yea then they must be Ruled by them, as their Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If Conquest were a Title to Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it would belong to all that conquered: And I doubt not but there are ten, if not twenty Souldiers in the Countrey that have laid down Arms since the enemy was conquered, for one that is yet remaining in the Army that had a part in that Conquest.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If Conquest were such a Title, I have reason to believe that it is but a small part of the Army comparatively that have that Title, as being not in the Army at the Conquest: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that most of them are since come in, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many at least.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You say that the Good People not in Arms, owning the same Cause, have the same Right: Therefore it is not meerly by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. For they conquered not so much as we
<pb facs="tcp:170314:36"/> that continued in the Army, till the first Warre was ended.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>present Officers</hi> at <hi>this last Change</hi> were not all of a mind, that yet had an equal hand in Conquest. And how comes an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make one part of the Conquerours to be the Rulers of the rest?</p>
            <p n="10">10. If Conquest gave the Army Power to Rule or Resist, then it seems they had just Power to put out this Parliament when they did it, and may do so again, if they think it best: And may they do so by <hi>all future</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in their time, or <hi>not?</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> how come they to have more Power over <hi>that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> which they served under, than over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? If they have such Power over <hi>all,</hi> then why do they not tell us so, and exercise the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment themselves.</p>
            <p>In a word, here is no room for any rational plea for a Right of Soveraignty by Conquest. And if there were, it would be in the <hi>Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the Conquerours, that are not in the Army. And if there be no Right of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, there must be Subjection, and no more Right of Resisting than other Subjects have. And if it be confined to the owners of the fore-described <hi>Cause,</hi> then the Army is excluded, that hath disowned that Cause: Or if they did own it, it seems they would lose
<pb facs="tcp:170314:37"/> their Power, when ever they should change their opinion.</p>
            <p>Teach not <hi>all Armies</hi> (that say they have higher ends than money) to take themselves for the Conquerours of their Soveraigns: And teach not <hi>future Parliaments</hi> that Doctrine, lest they choose a cheaper slavery from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, rather than the raising of an Army to depose themselves.</p>
            <p>In all this, I pretend not that the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Authour is any further against my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, than his plain expressions satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Reader: For I am not sure in this point of Conquest that I well understand him.</p>
            <p>But I may safely conclude, That they that go against <hi>[the Laws and Constitutions of Government]</hi> and take <hi>[Successe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for their Law]</hi> and <hi>[their military capacity for their utmost and last reserve, in case all other fail,]</hi> (as he speaks, <hi>pag.</hi> 9.) have a lamentable Cause, and setting their wisdome against the Lords, and making their conceits or interest their Law, do fall under the terrible Threatnings of the Word, against the Resisters of Authority.</p>
            <p>Prop. 9. <hi>They that pretend [the inward warrant of Justice and Righteousnesse]</hi> (as he speaketh <hi>pag.</hi> 9.) and <hi>[the inward reason
<pb facs="tcp:170314:37"/> and spirit of Government] for the violation of Laws or Constitutions, or Resisting of Authority, as being above [the Letter, Form, outward circumstances, and empty shadows] do reject the Government of the Lord, and become their own Governours.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 1. The Rule of Righteousnesse is without us in the Laws; and there can be no such thing as an Inward Righteousnesse, which is contrary to that outward Law, the Rule of Righteousnesse. There can be no such thing as an inward Righteousnesse, that is not conformed to the Rule of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because that conformity is its essential form.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be the <hi>Intention of a good end, that is here meant by the Inward Reason and spirit of Government]</hi> it's commonly known that the <hi>means</hi> must be good as well as the <hi>end;</hi> and that a Good end will not justifie bad means.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Were it the proper sense of the Law that is called <hi>[the reason and spirit of it]</hi> that's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the <hi>Letter,</hi> we should all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the sense is the Law, and the Letter is but to signifie the sense or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that <hi>all</hi> would not <hi>have failed,</hi> to cast them on their military capacity as a <hi>last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:170314:38"/>4. We all confesse that there are cases in which the Law of God may nullifie contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws of men, and the end being of Gods appointment, and the means but of mans, or else but of Positive institution, when the means ceaseth to be a means, and is inconsistent with the end, it may cease to be a duty. But 1. That will not allow men to set up means of their own, forbidden by God, and to do evil that good may come by it. 2. And I have proved that it must be a greater necessity than any could be here pretended. As it is dangerous pretending a Necessity of Violating other Laws as in the Letter; and to murder, commit adultery, steal, bear false witnesse, upon that pretence; so it is dangerous as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour our Natural or Civil Father, or Resist them, much more to depose them, on such a pretence, where there is not indeed a warranting necessity.</p>
            <p>I long thought that the too easie pleading the Reason and spirit of Gods Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Worship against the Letter and Form, would grow to the like usage of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy and mans Laws. But what God hath joyned, no man should seperate. As the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be kept under, and used as a servant to the soul, when yet to seperate them is self-murder; and as the outward Ordinances of
<pb facs="tcp:170314:38"/> Worship must be used in a subserviency to the internal graces of the Spirit; but not be cast off on supposition that they are hinderances: So Magistrates and their Laws must be obeyed in a subordination to God and his Laws; but not cast off, resisted, or deposed, without and against the Authority of the Universal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p>But if all this were otherwise, yet the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the fore-described (evil) <hi>Cause,</hi> have nothing from the Spirit and Reason of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, against them that have the Wisdom and Honesty to disown it.</p>
            <p>Yea, if men should really do good to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by such unwarrantable Resistance, it will not justifie them from the guilt of the sinne.</p>
            <p>Prop. 10. <hi>For all this the Honourable Author doth assert,</hi> (pag. 10.) That <hi>[unto the wisdom of the Laws and Orders of the Soveraign Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Sword is to become most entirely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and subservient:] Therefore so should your Sword have been to the Parliament that was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are no small fruits that would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by your conviction, if these evident Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might prevail for your Repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your souls would be saved from the guilt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:170314:39"/>2. Thousands may be saved from making the sinne their own by an after-consent or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You will stop here, and go on no further, and no longer keep out so many faithfull Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, under the name of the corrupt Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And when we are set in joynt again, by your Restitution to your Subjection and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and our Rulers Restitution to their Power and Trust, and the Peoples Restitution to their Rights and Liberties, our Peace and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be Restored.</p>
            <p>As I was concluding, I received two Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: One by Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> expressing his just indignation against an Oligarchy, or the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of a self-conceited Party, in stead of a true Commonwealth. The other to Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> in a Letter (of the same style with the Answer to the <hi>Healing Question)</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the <hi>Godly</hi>'s <hi>Interest,</hi> and a Senate to have the <hi>Proposing</hi> and <hi>Executive Power.</hi> I leave it to the Reader, whether the way I here hold be not the true Mean between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams? That All be acknowledged free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, that subject themselves to God in Christ, and to the true Soveraign Power: yet so as that wickednesse forfeit their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>And we must earnestly crave, that the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:170314:39"/> Party</hi> may not be defined by the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned points of the ill Cause (Popular Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and common Liberty in all matters of Worship, and of Faith, as things without the reach of Magistrates.) The lesse Humility, the lesse Godlinesse: But how little Humility have they that take all to be ungodly through the Land, that agree not with them in this bad opinion? It is <hi>[the whole Party of Honest men]</hi> that the Authour of the <hi>Healing Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> would have <hi>one civil Incorporation,</hi> pag. 11. where he shews the danger to <hi>[the Army and their Governours, that may come by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and keeping up themselves in a divided interest from the rest of the Body of Honest men.]</hi> But he that can confine the <hi>whole body of honest men,</hi> to so narrow a room as the <hi>Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the aforesaid Cause,</hi> will give away one of his best Arguments (his Charity) by which he should prove himself an Honest man.</p>
            <p>And we as earnestly crave, that neither such a Senate, nor any other new form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be imposed on the Nation or set up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their free consent.</p>
            <p>And if these just demands should be denied us, and we should be unrighteously enslaved by our Brethren, we Appeal to the Justice of the most righteous God.</p>
            <p>The snare is here laid so open to our eyes
<pb facs="tcp:170314:40"/> (even the Design to set up a party over us, that by a Fundamental Constitution shall be engaged to debase the Magistracy, and let in Popery and Impiety upon the Land,) that nothing but force can procure the Body of the Nation to Consent. If ever so vile a thing be done, and the name of Liberty or Commonwealth, be used as a scorn to an enslaved Peace, the Lord be Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and our Oppressours.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Some must be suborned to beg importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Prince for Liberty to exercise their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that with many and gentle words, that so the People may think the Prince is not enclined to Novelty, but only to Lenity, and to a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for tender consciences, and that he doth it not as from himself.

               <p n="4">4. When the Zeal of Professours begins to rise against the change, they are to be pacified by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting both parties to conference before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let there be a Decree for Pacification, that
<pb facs="tcp:170314:42"/> one party do not rail at the other, nor calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate them. And so the errours that are to be brought in will have great advantage, when they are covered, and may not be contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or so much as named: And so the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers will be thought to be onely Lovers of Peace, and not to intend a change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Next that let there be some publick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations between the Parties, but with some disadvantage to them that are to be outed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let all this be done but on pretence that the several Parties may be joyned loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together in Peace: And when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters refuse this, let them be accused of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceablenesse, and pride, and obstinacy, and disobedience against the Magistrate, and not for their Religion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When it comes to the putting out of some Ministers, and the People begin to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for them, let the matter be carried si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; and in the mean time, let the People be told, that it is because those Ministers are heady, obstinate men; that the People may be perswaded that the Ministers are faulty, and have deserved it, and may be put one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to desire Liberty for the more Peaceable men.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb facs="tcp:170314:42"/>9. When thus the people are deluded, and there is no danger of a resistance, then turn the Ministers out of the Churches, and put in those that you would set up in their stead.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Then change the Universities, and tell all the Fellows and Scholars, that they shall hold their places if they will turn, else not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many will change Religion with the Rulers.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Next he instanceth in</hi> Aasia <hi>where the Prince pretended, that all the</hi> Professors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters places were void at the death of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor, and he had the disposall of them, by Law.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And the change was there made <hi>(as he pretends)</hi> by slow degrees, one or two Opinions only changed at the first, and not the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted part of the Religion; and so the people will think it but as a small matter to yield in one or two Opinions, and be easily brought to obey.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Lastly, They fall to writing against each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and those that have the Court-favour seem to carry it.</p>
               <p>All this Advice is about the third Direction, that is, how to work out the Ministers safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which he covers under pretended instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such as have changed Religion in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Rule is, To put out of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Dignities, and publique Offices, all those
<pb facs="tcp:170314:43"/> that are most adverse to Popery: It is but just that those that hinder the safety of the Commonwealth, should be deprived of the honours and Riches of the Commonwealth. If men are deposed for heynous Crimes, why not for Blasphemy and Contempt of Truth? <hi>(you must believe the</hi> Jesuite <hi>that this is the Protestant Case.)</hi> If those of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion be left in honour and power, they will be able to cross the Prince in many things, and encourage the People of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Rule is, That when a Heresie <hi>(for so is the Protestant Religion to them)</hi> is wholly to be rooted out, and this must be done by degrees, and in a way of reason, and cannot be done by meer Command and Power, then you must first fall on those opinions that the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are most against, and which you can quickly make them think absurd: <hi>so he instanceth in some</hi> that would work out <hi>Lutheranism,</hi> that speak honourably of <hi>Luther,</hi> and fell on them only under the name of <hi>Flaccians:</hi> so the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> when they would extirpate <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinisme,</hi> made a Decree, that no man should Preach any thing, that seemed to make God the Author of sinne. Thus a Magistrate that would bring in Popery, must fall upon such heynous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which the impudent themselves are half <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hamed of; and bring these into the light that
<pb facs="tcp:170314:43"/> they may be odious, and so the Teachers will lose all their Authority, when the people see that they are taken in a manifest fault.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The sixth Rule to bring in Popery, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish the Protestants Religion, is, to make use of the Protestants Contentions. How easie is it <hi>(saith he)</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to bring the Puritans into Order, if they be forced to approve of Bishops? or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Puritans in the Low Countries, if the Prince adhere to the <hi>Arminians?</hi> For the Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Opinions makes them doubtfull, that before seemed certain; so that when the Magistrate joyneth with one side, he easily overturns the other, and leaves the whole obnoxious: As <hi>Paul</hi> did by the dissention between the Pharisees and Saduces, joyning to one side, he escaped. This <hi>(saith he)</hi> I would principally perswade an Orthodox Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to <hi>(that is, a Papist.)</hi> For he may with as much advantage make use of the Protestants dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements, as of the Papists Concord, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Protestants. As in Warres, it is not only the skill and strength of the Generall, but often also the Carelesnesse of the Enemy, or his Mistake that give very great advantages for successe. When rigid <hi>Calvinism</hi> was assaulted by the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> in the heat of the Paroxysm, it was exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, and the suddain restraint did much hurt: But now the <hi>Arminians</hi> have of their own accord let go the hardest part of their rigor, and judg the
<pb facs="tcp:170314:44"/>
                  <hi>Calvinists</hi> to be impious, and persecute them in the very University, and in other Towns they force them to banishment; and would venture to do more and Crueller things, if they were not afraid of the strength of the adverse Party. Verily if Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> alone did but stand for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> the rigor of the contra-remonstrants would flag, or be broken.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The seventh Rule is to forbid the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants privately or publiquely to Assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The eighth Degree must be to proceed to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Laws and punishments: Here he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove this violence lawfull, <hi>(Fire and fagot, is reserved to the last.)</hi> But this violence though it must be for the change of all, need not be exercised on all. Cut off the Leaders, and the multitude will follow the Authority of the Rulers. Shame will retain some, and fear others, but a vain security will prevail with most, when they know not how to help it. Within these few years, <hi>(if he say true,)</hi> above an hundred thousand have been turned to Popery in <hi>France,</hi> and more in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Not any of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> that did endeavour to draw ever his People to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, did ever find any force or Resistance contrary to his Laws. <hi>Note this all you slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Papists that accuse Protestants so much of Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llion to hide your own: Here's a</hi> Jesuites
<pb facs="tcp:170314:44"/>
                  <hi>Testimony on Record for our vindication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Rule is, The good life of the Popish Magistrates and Clergy: <hi>(And that let them use as much as they will.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. He commendeth many smaller helps: As 1. Muisck, to entise people by delight. 2. To cause all at their marriage to professe the Popish Religion, and so rather then go without a Wife or Husband they will do it. 3. So also to deny to Protestants Church-Priviledges, at Baptism, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly he Concludes, That where the work must be secretly done by degrees, the Magistrate must keep the Institutions, Presentation, Confirmation, and Examination of Ministers in his own hand; and so (if he cannot cast them out at once) he must cast out the most dangerous, <hi>(that is, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Protestant Pastours,)</hi> and put over the Churches, the Disagreeing, and those that do not mind matters of Controversie much, and those that are addicted to their own Domestick businesses <hi>(worldly men,)</hi> and such as are addicted to the Rulers: Let him coole the heat of Heresie, <hi>(he means true Religion;)</hi> and let him not put out the Unlearned: and so their Religion will grow into contempt.</p>
               <p>Let the Magistrate cherish the Dissentions of the erring <hi>(he means the Protestant)</hi> Teachers: and let him procure them often to debate together,
<pb facs="tcp:170314:45"/> and reprove one another. For so when all men see that there is nothing certain among them, they will easily yield to the truth <hi>(he means Popery.)</hi> And this Discord is profitable to shew the manners of those wicked men. For he that will read the Contentious Writings of <hi>Lutherans</hi> against <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,</hi> or <hi>Calvinists</hi> against <hi>Lutherans,</hi> will think he readeth, not the invectives of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst men, but the furies and roaring of Devils against Devils. <hi>A fair warning! But the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite tells you not what is done at home.)</hi> From these things the Ruler may take occasion for a change: Let him enquire into the Original of these accusations: And if he find them true, he may punish the Guilty. If false, he may punish, <hi>(that is, cast out)</hi> the Accusers.</p>

To have Seminaries in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that for the changing of our Religion, may first sow the seeds of Division in points of natural Sciences. 3.

               <p>HE that denyeth this, denyeth himself to be a man, and therefore is not to be disputed with: yet proveth it to others, while he denyeth it.</p>

               <p>We see it of all the Individuals, that they by Generation receive their Existence; There is no man alive now here in flesh, that was alive a thousand years ago. Generation succeedeth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And as all men that are now on earth had a Beginning, so must there be one <hi>first man</hi> that also had a <hi>Beginning.</hi> Or else he must have been a pure Act, without Composition, or imperfection, self-sufficient, and without cause, and so not have been <hi>Man</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> and therefore not the supposite that we speak of: And as he had been infinite in Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>a part ante,</hi> so must he be <hi>a parte post:</hi> for that which have no <hi>cause,</hi> can have dissolution or end. But this is not the case of man: therefore man had a Beginning.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. Man did not make himself.</q>
               <p>For before <hi>he was, he was not:</hi> and that which <hi>is not,</hi> cannot work. Nothing can do nothing: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever made him, knew what he did, and how, and why. But neither he that was not, nor his parents knew either what was doing while he was formed in the womb, and how he was fashioned, nor to what end each part and motion was appointed. Therefore neither did we make our selves. nor are our Parents the principal cause of our Being. Nor could the first man be made by himself when he was not, or his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that had none.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. Therefore man hath a superior Maker.</q>
               <p>If he be an effect, he must have a <hi>cause.</hi> Nothing below can be his principal Cause: Nothing doth lay claim to such an honor; Nothing is sufficient for such a work: All things below are effects themselves, and therefore have their causes.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. Man being a living Creature, consisting of soul and body, his soul is vegetative, sensitive and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, (or intellectual) and hath an Intellect to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, a Will to chuse or refuse, and a Power to execute its Commands.</q>
               <p>Sense it selfe is a sufficient Discerner that we are sensible: and Sense and Reason that we are vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: And Reason sufficiently discerneth that we are rational: not by an immediate intuition of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but by an immediate Intellection of its own Acts. While I reason to prove that man is rationall, and you reason against it, we both prove it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 6. Wisdom is the due qualification of mans Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; and Vertue, or moral Goodnesse of his Will, and Ability, and Promptitude for Execution of his executive Power.</q>
               <p>Mans soul is <hi>capable</hi> of these; and some in a less, and some in a more excellent degree are possessed of them: so few men will confess themselves to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void of Wisdom and Goodness, that we need not prove the existence of these Endowments.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170314:52"/>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 7. He that made man, doth excell all men that he ever made in all perfections of understanding, Will and Power.</q>
               <p>For no one can give that which he hath not to give, either formaly or eminently: Nothing of it self can make that which is better then it selfe: for then all the superabundant perfection of the effect should be without a cause. He therefore that made man, must needs have more Power, Wisdom and Goodness then all the men that are, or ever were in the world: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had none but what he gave them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 8. He that is the principal cause of man, is an Eternal, Immense, most perfect Being, an infinite Power, VVisdom and Goodness, that is, he is God.</q>
               <p>Either man was made by a Creature, that had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a Maker, or immediately by the uncaused Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, Simple, independent being, which is the cause of all things else. If he were made by a Creature, that Creature being but a dependent Being, could be but dependent in its causation, and so could be but the instrument of, or subservient to the principal cause. And as the first cause is not diminished, or loseth not any of his perfection by making the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and communicating to them, no more is he the less in any effect, because he useth them: But as they have no Being but from him, so they can do nothing but by him; and as his perfections are as glorious, as if there were no Creature in Being; so the effects, which as his instruments, the Creatures perform, are as much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170314:52"/> his own, as if there had been no Instruments. For if they are Creatures, they can neither <hi>have</hi> nor do any good but wholly from the Creator; so that if it could be proved, (as it cannot) that the first cause did immediately make man, yet would it not alter our case, or conclude him to be ever the less our Maker.</p>
               <p>And that he is an eternal Being without Beginning or cause, is clear: For else there should be a time, (as we may call it) when there was <hi>Nothing.</hi> And if ever there had been a time when there was <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> there never would have been any thing: For nothing can do nothing, and make nothing: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thinketh God had a Beginning, thinketh that he was caused by nothing, without a cause: and so that all things were made by nothing.</p>
               <p>And as the Eternity of God is thus most clear, and is his Immensity. For he made not that which is greater then himselfe, or that can comprehend him, else he should communicate more then he hath, and the effect to be beyond its total cause, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: And if he comprehend all things, and be greater then all things, he must be immense. And that he is infinite in Power, Wisdom, and Goodnesse, and so most perfect, is clear, because all the Power, Wisdom and Goodnesse of the Creature is from him; and therefore he hath more himselfe then all the Creatures have: and therefore is infinite in all. If all the Power, Wisdom and Goodness in all the world were contracted into one person, it must be less then his that giveth all. None can make that which is better then itselfe. I pass by all other Arguments, as intending at this time no other demonstrations; but

               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 9. The soul of man is capable of knowing that there is a God, whose everlasting favour is his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of loving him, desiring him, and seeking to enjoy him: and he may know, that nothing here below can be his proper end and happiness.</q>
               <p>THE experience of all that have the least time, Godliness doth assure us of the truth of this. Thus it is with them: They are convinced of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all things else, and their desires are set on the life to come. And what they profess, the rest of men are capable of. The soul liveth quite below it selfe, and without any true satisfaction or content, or any true improvement of its faculties, that lives for no more then temporal things, and looks for no life after this.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>These.</hi> 10. The nature of man is fitted to be here ruled by the hopes and fears of a life to come: and without these the world cannot be ruled according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man.</q>
               <p>We see <hi>de facto</hi> that most of the world is <hi>ruled</hi> by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170314:54"/> some hopes and fears of a life to come. <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and most Infidels profess to believe it; Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their Law-givers, who therefore make the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Laws. And the same nature of man, and common experience declareth, that were it not for such hopes and fears, the world would turn <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and be like so many ravenous beasts. Men in Power would have nothing sufficient to restrain them from the greatest wickedness; and secret Murders, Burnings, Stealings, Slanders, Whoredoms, and other Villanies would fill the world. So that the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Threats</hi> of a Happiness or Misery hereafter, are Gods means agreeable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, for the due Government of mankind.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 11. Therefore the soul of man is immortal, and he is made for a life to come, where he shall be for ever happy or miserable.</q>
               <p>For God maketh his Creatures suitable to their use and ends. Every work-man will fit his tools, or other work to the end he makes them for. God hath not bestowed these noble faculties on man in vain. If he would have had him uncapable of enjoying God hereafter, he would have left him as he hath done the bruits, uncapable of knowing him, desiring and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. If he would not have <hi>given</hi> us another life, nor punish the wicked with a future misery, he would not have <hi>promised</hi> or <hi>threatned</hi> such things, nor ruled the world by the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> of them. For God is not <hi>impotent</hi> or <hi>defective</hi> in Wisdom and Goodness, that he should choose, or be necessitated, to govern the world by deceits and lies. He hath his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170314:55"/> choice of better means: and tells us in the nature of his works for what he made them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 12. Were there not a life to come for man, his Knowledge, Desires, Hopes and Fears, would be his torment, and the nobleness of his nature above brutes, would make him so much more miserable than they, and the wisest men, and the best would be most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: which are things not to he believed.</q>
               <p>It is apparent, that the knowledge of a God and Happiness, which we may not enjoy, would tantalize us; and the fore-knowledge of an everlasting mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as possible and probable to the ungodly, would be a continual cause of fear and care to us: And there is not a Heathen that ever I yet met with, or scarce ever heard of, thar dare say, <hi>He is sure that there is no life to come:</hi> They all confess, <hi>That it may be so, for ought they know,</hi> though some of them take it to be unlikely and do not believe it. Now the very <hi>Possibility</hi> which is discerned <hi>by almost all,</hi> and the Probability which is discerned by most, must needs excite abundance of cares, and fears, and sorrows, which would be all in vain, and deluso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, and vexations, if there were no such thing, as a life to come, which is the Object of these affections: yea, the wiser any man is, the more he knoweth the insufficiency and vanity of all below, and the great Probability of a life to come; supposing him to be without a certainty) And therefore if there were no such future state the wisest men should be the most deluded, and so prove in the end the most foolish, which is a thing not to be supposed, that the most wise and perfect Author of nature should be guilty of. God would not have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170314:55"/> given man wisdome as his Excellency, and the image of his Maker, thereby setting him above the rest of the inferior world, and all this to make him indeed a more miserable, deluded, befooled Creature, and the scorn, as it were of nature! The Lord of nature doth better suite his works unto their ends, and is not the common deceiver of the world.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 13. If there were no life for man but this, mens pious performance of their duty to God and man, and their prudent care of their own felicity would be their losse; and mens wickedness and folly would be their gain, and the worst would be least miserable: which are things not once to be imagined.</q>
               <p>It is impossible that any man should be a loser by God, and by the faithful performance of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Satan himself, when he would make man mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, endeavoreth to that end to make him sinful, as the onely way; and never dreameth of making him miserable by his duty; nor hath the impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to move that he may be destroyed for well-doing: It is abhorrent from the wisdome and goodness of the blessed God, to set man in the world upon a course of duty, which the more he performeth, the more he loseth by it. The work is good, or else it could not be our duty: and the doing of good must tend to our good, and not to our hurt. It is mans perfection or excellency to be obedient to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and to exercise wisdom, piety, honesty, and a due care of his own felicity, to which his nature doth so potently incline him: therefore to think that this is his folly or loss, is a contradiction to the nature of the thing.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170314:56"/>
               <p>And that such a course of duty is naturally incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us is evident: For nature teacheth us that the God that made us should be feared, and loved, and served above all: and that we should live soberly, righteously and piously; Yea, more then so, when the <hi>worser</hi> sort of <hi>Infidels and Heathens</hi> cannot say, that <hi>they are sure their is no life to come:</hi> and when the <hi>most of the world</hi> believe <hi>there is;</hi> and when the common reason of man-kind (even of the Heathens) acknowledgeth it to be <hi>probable,</hi> in this case, the plainest voice of <hi>Reason</hi> doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, to make it the very care and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this life to make preparation for another. When we all know how short, uncerain and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vain, and unworthy to be much regarded, the pleasures, and profits and honours of the world are, or any thing that it can yeild us, Reason tells us that he is worse then mad, that will not prefer a <hi>probable</hi> everlasting happiness, and the avoiding of a <hi>probable</hi> future misery, before such things as these. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Reason</hi> telleth men, that if there be such a <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of future joyes and sorrows, it should be the <hi>principal</hi> care and business of our lives to attaine that joy, and avoid that sorrowe (though there were no <hi>certainty)</hi> so that mans <hi>natural Reason</hi> concludeth that the principal work of his life on earth, should be to prepare for another life, so exceeding great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as that, being not for a lesser to be neglected, or rashly ventured.</p>
               <p>But now if after this, there were no such life of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture joyes and sorrows for us, then all this care and diligence were lost; and that course of life that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it self directs man to, would be in vain, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170314:56"/> is not to be imputed to him that giveth wisdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man: And as he that performeth his duty most carefully to God, would suffer most in the world (as experience telleth us) and most be deprived of the pleasures, and honours, and profits which the flesh desireth, and so be deprived of that which sensuality accounteth felicity; so on the contrary side, the most impious and unconscionable men would be freed from all the foresaid cares and fears, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of wise men for another life, and would have liberty to please their flesh, and live in all the sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delights that they can attain, and so they would be gainers by their folly and badness; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly folly would be wisdom, and wisdom would be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; good would be evill, and evil would be good. It being certain then that a <hi>possibility and probability</hi> of another life is obvious to the light of nature, and that this <hi>possibility and probability</hi> obligeth every man in reason, to live here in preparation to another life, and to think no paines or cost too great for so great an end, and consequently that the God of nature, hath in nature prescribed man this work; it must needs follow, that either there is such a life indeed hereafter, or else that God hath made our nature, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our lives to be all but vain, and false, and delusory, and commanded us, or directed us to that as good, which shall be our loss; and shewed us that as evil, which would be our gain; And if God cannot or will not govern the world without this course of delusion, falshood, and frustration, then he is below some of his creatures, or at least not perfect in power, wisdom and goodness: and then there is no God, and then there is nothing.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 14. It is not the essential constitutive parts of man, by which he is proximately capable of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity or end, but his moral perfections and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse to God.</q>
               <p n="1">1. Otherwise <hi>all men should be happy,</hi> because all ate men, which is not true. 2. Otherwise <hi>there should no means be appointed</hi> for man to use, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his end; for he hath his natural powers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any industry of his own. 3. Else there should be an <hi>equality or felicity</hi> to the obedient and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, the vertuous and vitious, and consequently vertue were no perfection and no vertue, and vice no vice; duty no duty, and sin no sin, if all tended to the same end, and were equally consistent with our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. 4. The light of nature teacheth all men, that vice deserveth punishment, and vertue praise, and that Murderers, Traitors, and other wicked persons deserve not that happinesse in this world, which others have, but forfeit their accommodations or lives; and that there is a certain laudableness or capableness in humane actions, according to which men should be esteemed and used, and that it should go well with the good, and ill with the bad. 5. And mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse being Gods gift, can be given to none but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his termes, and to such as are acceptable to him. 6. And the corruption of the best things makes them worst; and therefore a bad man is worse then a beast, and must be more unhappy; as a bad Angel is worse then a man: who otherwise considered in his essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als was much above us.</p>

God can carry a man up and down, as if he had no life of his own: but if he had intended to do thus ordinarily by him, he would not have given him life: for he doth not his excellent works in vaine; so God can move man as beasts are moved suspending his reason, and drawing him by meere sensitive baites, and moving him by objects that shall necessitate his faculties to act; but if he had intended to use him as a beast, he would have made him but sensitive as a beast, and not have given him the nobler faculties of a discursive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, and free-wil in vaine.

               <p>But one <hi>Thomas Anglus ex Albiis East-saxonum,</hi> in English, <hi>Thomas White, a Papist,</hi> in his book about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and his other Writings, would perswade us, that such notions as these are but Metaphorical, and the conceits of vulgar heads, when properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to God, and that indeed they that are wiser, know that God governeth as an Engeneer, that is, by a Physicall Premotion only, as men govern Clocks and Watches, or the <hi>Pilate</hi> governeth a ship.]</p>
               <p>But 1. Scripture cannot be so eluded by any that truly believed it to be Gods Word, its evidence is so plain and full. All that it saith might else be denyed with such an answer as this; But affirmation is no proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is before proved, that a meer Physical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Government is not suited to the nature of the rational Creature: but that he must be governed by the proposal of convenient Objects, it is by Laws or moral Government. 3. If man can be governed without Laws, why do Parents command, and Princes make Laws, and judge men by them. 4. Man must
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170314:62"/> be ruled by his Creators Will, not meerly as operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing physically by a secret influx, but as known; And we cannot know Gods Will immediately; for no man hath seen God at any time; who hath gone up into Heaven? but we must go to the word that is nigh us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. Only by <hi>Signs</hi> can we know Gods Will concerning our Duty; and those signs are Laws.</p>
               <p>But I suppose that Mr. <hi>White</hi> doth mean, that God hath Laws, but yet these Laws do infallibly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and objects necessitate the Will, and so all Causality is properly physical, and that which we call Moral, affecteth as necessarily as that which we call Physicall, though man cannor see the force of causes in their connexion and secret influence.</p>
               <p>But 1. If this were true, that moral operations thus cause, yet still it is one thing to govern a rational Creature by the force of duly proposed Objects, and another to move him as a lifeless stone: And if the first way of Government be granted as to God, he will still be the universal Monarch. (And let them consider how the Pope can reign as Vice-God, or Vice-Christ, if God, if Christ himself do not reign.]</p>
               <p>But 2. We shall not beleeve such bold Assertions without better proofe then he hath given. 1. Because we know that there is true contingency in the world, which his Assertion would overthrow. 2. we know that there is a Will in man that is a self determining Principle, and naturally free, and that this part of the naturall excellency of man, that's called Gods Image, and maketh him capable of moral proper Government, with B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uits are not. 3. Because his Doctrine of Necessitation by a train of Objects,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170314:62"/> overthroweth all Religion, and not only denyeth the scope of Scripture, but blasphemeth God, and denyeth the before manifested Truths, which the light of nature doth reveal. For which way ever men will wriggle, there is no shift left, for them that hold this unresistable causation of Objects, as to the Will, but plainly they must affirm, that God is the principal cause of all sin, (so far as it is capable of a cause) and consequently of all the calamities and damnation of the sinners. For whether it be by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating physical predetermination, or by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating objects, is all one. God is the chief cause of the faculties of the soul that are supposed thus to be necessitated, And God is the chief cause of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and their disposition; (and all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the opposed Doctrine) so that God is hereby made the chief unresistable determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cause of them to sin; even as much as by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire and straw, and setting them together, he is the cause of the combustion. And then that he should hate sin which is principally his own work, and send his Son to die for it, and damn the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for it, will not be believed, but taken for sceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Delusions, by those that practically hold this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And so Scripture and Christianity is made a scorn, and all Religion and Conscience overthrown. All this we will believe, when Mr. <hi>White</hi> hath proved that a <hi>Man</hi> is a <hi>Beast,</hi> and that the <hi>Will</hi> hath no more freedom then the <hi>Appetite</hi> of a <hi>Bruit.</hi> But he debaseth the noble nature of man, and knoweth not the natural liberty of the Will, which makes man capable of a Government, different not only from the motion of a Jack, or Clock, or Ship, but al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If one of a thousand may perish, and yet God escape your Judgement, why not one of nine hundred? and why not one of eight hundred? and why not halfe, or most. 2.

If so, why were you so modest, as to be ashamed to speak out, and say, that you demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that none shall perish? 3. Experience telleth us, that it is too considerable a part of the world that are ungodly, sensual, Gluttons, Drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Murderers, yea, most of the world by far
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170314:64"/> that are Infidels and Idolaters, and millions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not a life to come, and seek not after it, yea, that hate and persecute them that do. And shall all, or almost all these be saved? What danger is there then in sin, and what is the use of Christianity, or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or Conscience, if the Heathens, and Infidels, and impious are so generally happy? Is this Popery? and this the Champion of the Roman cause? 4. Do such Papists as these believe the Scripture, that so frequently and plainly speak the contrary, telling us, That <hi>[the Gate is strait, and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few there be that finde it,</hi> Mat. 7. <hi>and that many shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able,</hi> Luk. 13. 24.] and that it is a little <hi>flock</hi> that shall have the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12 32.] And that without <hi>Holiness none shall see God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Nor enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdom without Regeneration, and Conversion, and mortifing the flesh, and living after the spirit, and doing the will of God,</hi> John. 3. 3, 5.

Or is he a Christian that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them not? And is he not of no <hi>Religion,</hi> or a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170314:64"/> false <hi>Religion,</hi> or false to his Religion, that is ashamed to own it, but will pretend to be a Papist, a Christian, when he is no such thing? 5. Nay, would not <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and most sober Heathens have been ashamed of these men? and Jews, and <hi>Mahometans</hi> think them unworthy of their Communion? When all these profess to believe the necessity of honesty at least, to the attainment of felicity! But these men pluck up all Religion by the roots, and tell almost all the swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish impious dishonest persons in the world of a certainty of salvation. (but wo to them that trust to their demonstrations) Forsooth, <hi>The world is naught if it bring them not to happiness!</hi> And what need then of <hi>Honesty</hi> to <hi>Felicity,</hi> when the rout of the dishonest are sure of it without it? Are these principles fit for Magistrates to allow their people to read, unless they desire their perdition? 6. But to his <hi>Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Before he had come to his <hi>Ergo,</hi> he had many things first to have proved; as, that the <hi>World is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and sufficient Instrument, without supernaturall or speciall Revelations; That this instrument is not only a propounded and commanded means,</hi> but that God hath absolutely decreed and resolved <hi>de eventu,</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the felicity of all (or almost all) men by it: and that with almost all the Heathens, and Idolaters, and Whore-mongers, and Murderers in the world, this <hi>Instrument</hi> doth not only bring <hi>Felicity</hi> to their <hi>choice,</hi> (and the way to felicity) but also unresistably or <hi>effectually cause them to choose it, or save them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a choice; and that there is nothing for man to do for his felicity, but to be wheeled to it by the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of the world; and that the haters of holiness shall be happy without Holiness,</hi> that is, <hi>Happy without
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170314:65"/> happiness,</hi> or sound and healthfull without health, or else shall be made holy by the world at the departing of their soules, and that against their wills, when he hath proved such impieties and contradictions as these, we shall review his demonstration.</p>
               <p>But his great foundation is [Propos. 4. <hi>Deus Creat caetera propter ipsamet:]</hi> demonstrated thus, <hi>[Cum enim nihil extra Deum sit illi amabile</hi> (which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demonstrated in spight of Scripture and nature too) <hi>&amp; natum perficere ipsum, clarum est, si solus Deus consideretur, indifferens esse, Creata sint nec ne: Quare cum Agens ex cognitione agat ex intentione boni, clarum est, Deum in creatione intendere bonum ipsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum creaturarum, seu creare illas, ut ipsis, non sibi, bene si.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It seems then God loveth not the Creature, and yet made the world for them only, and not himselfe.

The good pleasure of his will produced all things, and the fulfilling or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the same will is the end of all things. Its not possible that God should have any ultimate end but himself, nor that any of his operations should be ultimately for any thing below him that is their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; Can the infinite God make a temporary fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite imperfect Creature the ultimate end of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, This were to make it God; it being his prerogative to be the <hi>Omega</hi> as well as the <hi>Alpha, Thomas Aquinas</hi> is more to be regarded here then

That which is chiefly loved by the principall Agent, is chiefly intended in his principal works at least: but Mr. <hi>White</hi> thinks that no Creature is amiable to God, therefore none can be loved by him: therefore none can be his ultimate end</p>
               <p n="2">2. But you say, It <hi>was indifferent to God whether they were created or no? Answ.</hi> To his <hi>commodity</hi> it was indifferent, that is, he needed them not: and to his <hi>will</hi> it was <hi>free,</hi> if you mean <hi>that by indifferency:</hi> But yet that <hi>free will</hi> chose to make a world, and to communicate his goodness to his Creatures, for their felicity and not for his own, (that could receive no addition from them) but yet <hi>for himself,</hi> even they and their felicity being ultimately for the <hi>good pleasure of his will.</hi> God can fulfill or please his own free will, without receiving any addition of <hi>felicity,</hi> and yet all the felicity of the Creatures shall be but a means to that <hi>his pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which was Gods ultimate End must be before his intention (the <hi>finis cui)</hi> for it is not possible that he should intend so much for nothing; for that which was not amiable or existent, nor could be so much as in <hi>esse cognito,</hi> if the will of God had not first caused it: and God doth not wholly and directly go out of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170314:66"/> himself in his Volitions: But no Creature had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Gods Intentions, nor could their being be intended by him with out the pre-existence of him to whom their being should be ultimately refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How far <hi>Intentio finis</hi> is properly agreeable to God, and what it is that is called by us, <hi>Intention</hi> in God, is no more known to you, then how many stars are in the firmament, and when proud men will reduce the greatest matters, and clearest certainties, to their uncertaine fancies they magnifie themselves to their own perdition, and prove the most pestilent enemies to the Church and truth.</p>
               <p>I conclude then that ultimately God doth not make his Creatures <hi>ut ipsis bene sit,</hi> but he makes them and disposeth of them, some to felicity, and some to servitude or misery for their sin, but all to the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his will.</hi> His <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>fountaine</hi> beyond which no cause is to be assigned, and his <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>end,</hi> beyond which there is no end. And one would think this should be no controversie.</p>
               <p>And 4. I would know of this man, whether he would take it for a happinesse or not, to be a Toade or a Snake. If not, whether God is bound any more by the Law and reason of his Creation to make all men happy that <hi>deserve misery,</hi> rather then to make all <hi>Toads and Serpents</hi> to be men, that never sinned. If it cross not the reason of his works, that you should labour, and weary and famish, and beat and kill your Horse or Oxe, that sinned not: why should it crosse the reason of his Creation to condemn the obstinate despisers of his grace? If you say <hi>[because he made men for everlasting happinesse, and not beasts,]</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170314:66"/> 1. It is the <hi>temporall happiness</hi> of beasts that is denyed them. 2. He made <hi>wicked men</hi> no more for happiness, then Snakes and Toades, (unless <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> to offer them that happinesse which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse.)</p>
               <p>But let us hear the proof of this strange conclusion of yours; That <hi>[Nihil extra Deum est amabile ab ipso.</hi> Prop. 3.] This is all <hi>[Cum nihil sit amabile quod non sit bonum</hi> (true) <hi>neque bonum nisi habitum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectet habentem,</hi> (partly false) <hi>&amp; delectare habentem sit eum perficere</hi> (false as universally asserted) <hi>Cum delectatio sit precipuus actus cognoscentis, palam est, omne bonum esse intrinsecè perfectivum cognoscentis, cui est bonum, sed nihil est intrinsecè perfectivum Dei, cum in eo sit essentialiter omnis plenitudo entis seu perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis: nihil itaque extra Deum est Bonum &amp; ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. There is a <hi>Bonum in se &amp; simpliciter,</hi> as well as a <hi>Bonum alicui respectivum.</hi> As all love is not of <hi>Concupiscentiae</hi> proceeding from defect, (nor strictly <hi>amicitiae)</hi> so all good is not desired or used as a means, nor is <hi>bonum habitum,</hi> or desired, but some loved simply for it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All delectation or complacency is not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him that hath it. Scripture most frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth love, delight, and complacency to God, which are not to perfect him. I conclude then, that 1. God loves the creature as Love signifieth his will to doe it good. 2. He loves the good which he hath communicated to the Creature, as good according to its proportion, with a love of simple Approbation and Complacencie. Not that he loves any thing in it but what is from him, nor so without himself, as if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170314:67"/> all did not live, move and be existent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>m; but yet the good communicated to the Creature is distinct from God himself. All that is <hi>from God</hi> is <hi>good</hi> (he saw that which he had made to be good, and very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.) But <hi>good</hi> may be accounted amiable to God, therefore all that is from God may be accounted amiable to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What a God would this man feign to the world that loveth nothing that he hath made, (for he can love nothing that is not amiable) when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hateth nothing that he hath made, but for sin which he made not, and he is love it self. The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of Gods love to man in the work of Christ is his Incarnation, Life, Doctrine, &amp;c. and the work of the Spirit, and all Gods Ordinances, and the End of all his Mercies, and the very work and use of Heaven it self. And this learned man that's blinded with pride, would teach us now that God loveth no man and nothing but himself, God knows better then you what love is in himself who hath expressed it of himself. Ask any honest man on earth whether he believes this doctrine, or would have it true, that <hi>God loves no man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And what a world of Creatures doth this man feign that are none of them <hi>good and amiable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And see whether he teach us not all to deny our love to God. For 1. To tell men that God loves no man, is the way to have no man love him. 2. If God must love nothing for himself, because nothing is good to him, it will follow that man must love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for God ultimately, upon the same account. As nothing can add to God, so we must love nothing as that which can add to God: And therefore if that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170314:67"/> reason en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>h against Gods loving any thing for himselfe, it will be reason enough against our loving any thing for him. And if God doe all for man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can have no other end, then man must on the same reason doe all for himself. And therefore when he makes God mans End, he can mean but the final object that makes us happy, which is onely to love God for our selves, as our own felicity. But that God should be more loved simply for himselfe, then as our felicity is apparent: 1. In that nature taught the Heathens to love the common good, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their own felicity: therefore our own felicity is not our highest end. A valiant Heathen would have sacrificed his life for his Countries good: not onely for a reward to himself in another world, nor onely for the fame (if their Professions may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited) but for the common good. 2. And the light of natural Reason, telleth all them that have not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated Reason to selfishnesse, that every man <hi>should</hi> do thus: If the Common-wealth should perish unless my life redeemed it, or if my death would save the lives of ten thousand that are of greater use then I, my Reason tells me I should readily sacrifice my life for them, though I had no reward for it to my self: which was the ground of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Rom. 9. 3. [I could wish that my self were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, &amp;c.]</hi> Not that he actually made such a choice, for it was not offered to his choice: but that it was more eligible, if it had been offered, and if the perdition of one could be the salvation of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, it were in it self an evill to be undergone for so great a good; if it had been so appointed us of God. The greatest good is greatliest to be desired,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170314:68"/> though it be not our own. He that would not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be annihilated, rather then the Sun should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of its natural place and office, or the World annihilated, though it were supposed that he could survive) should go against the clearest light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That which resisteth this within us is Naturall instinct, or loathnesse to dye or be miserable, which is in every sensible <hi>Animal,</hi> and therefore is to be subjected to Reason as the Appetite is. Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>take away</hi> the <hi>appetite,</hi> and make a man love bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and loath sweet, &amp;c. but it may <hi>rule it:</hi> so it cannot <hi>take away our loathness to be miserable,</hi> but it may tell us that we should submit to it for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. And this sheweth that mans own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal felicity is not his highest end, even in the eye of natural reason. And if so, it is most certaine, that if we must goe above our selves, we must goe to the highest, which is to God: whose pleasure and complacency in his works, is above all the good of the works themselves, when we say <hi>[His glory is his end and ours]</hi> we meane that <hi>[the communication of his Excellency to his Creatures, and his glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in them in his Complacencie:]</hi> so that this Glory and Appearance is but <hi>Materially</hi> his end, but the <hi>complacencie</hi> of his <hi>Will)</hi> which was the beginning, is <hi>formally</hi> his End.</p>
               <p>And if still you dream like a man of Earth, that God can have no delight and <hi>complacencie,</hi> in any thing but himself, because he <hi>needeth</hi> nothing; and it cannot <hi>perfect</hi> him. <hi>I Answ. 1. Delight</hi> in God (whether in himselfe or another) is not such a thing as mans delight, nor is it to be comprehended by us, and therefore from things beyond our reach, we must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170314:68"/> not deny the evident truths that are within our reach. As God doth first take pleasure in himselfe without any note of imperfection, and deserves not to be accounted imperfect, because he is not most happy without that pleasure, so he next taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his Image, or the appearance of his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shining forth in the Creatures; which will be most eminently in his Son, as the Glorified Head of the Church, and then in the glorified Church his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And when he hath told us that he loveth and <hi>takes pleasure,</hi> and <hi>delighteth</hi> in his Sonne, and his Church, it is but a folly of a high nature for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, and say, he speaketh all this after our conceits: We grant that the expressions are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological or Metaphorical: But therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are not meere falsities, but signifies som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what transcendent in God, that hath so much ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or likeness to the Love, Complacency, Delight of man, that we cannot fitlier conceive of it then under these notions. And therefore we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude both that God delighteth, or takes pleasure in his works, and loveth Christ, and his Church, and yet that he doth not this to perfect himselfe, or adde any thing to his own felicity: but the very Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of his Will is his highest End; and therefore as it is folly to aske the Original of Gods will which is the Original of all things, so it is no less to aske what is the end of his will, which is the End of all things. To heap up here the plain abundant Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture, that there is Complacency and Love in God, to a Christian is needlesse, (and to most Heathens) but to Infidels that believe not the Scripture, is vaine. See <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. q. 20. <hi>art.</hi> 2. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170314:69"/> that <hi>God loveth all things,</hi> contrary to this <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Thomas,</hi> that saith, <hi>he loveth nothing, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is good.</hi> We shall only give him leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what he please as of himself. If he will needs maintain that he is not good himself nor amiable to God, and consequently to no good men, let him have his liberty.</p>

But 1. God doth not cause all the sin of the world, and make that a part of his Government of the world; nor doth he the less Govern when he Commandeth, because he doth not effect mens obedience, but permit them to disobey. We magnifie his Omnipotential operations, and that in the very sanctification of his servants; but we will not therefore deny his Sapiential frame of Government, nor say that God Governeth not when his Laws are broken, unlesse by causing men unavoidably to breake them.

               <p n="2">2. The proof of this universall Government of Angels is none, but the <hi>Ergo</hi> of a dreaming man, that snorteth Syllogismes. And therefore if we should not deny it, we must yet remember what <hi>Paul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth us concerning <hi>Mr. White,</hi> and the <hi>Bhemenists</hi> and such like, whom in their Ancestors he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, <hi>Col. 2. 18.

But yet he makes praying to them as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as it is to pray to the Sun to shine, or to the poise to move the Clock.)</p>

Is it Angels that send or <hi>give the holy Ghost to renew and sanctifie the Elect of God?</hi> or to <hi>inspire the Prophets.</hi> Prove this if you can. Or is the Holy Ghost some Angel? Neither can you prove that. You finde not in Nature or Scripture that the Image of God is wrought by Angels on the souls of men.</p>

Doth God doe all this remotely only, and Angels Proximately? Then Christ was an Angel? And is it Angels Proximately, and Christ remotely that shall judge the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though I deny not but Angels might be <hi>service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> in giving <hi>Moses</hi> Law, yet how prove you that Angels are our <hi>Law-givers? Laws</hi> we have, and <hi>Laws Divine?</hi> and they are none of them, given us in the <hi>name</hi> of any Angel as his Laws.

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Religion, Morality and pollicy, most of which I shall manifest brieffly in these following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have shewed already that it is a denying God to be God, because to be God, is to be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the world, at least in Title.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God be not Governour, he is not just: For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ommunicative Justice he cannot exercise on Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res that are wholly his own. And distributive Justice he can have none, if he have not the Relation which Justice doth belong to. He that is not a Ruler, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a just Ruler.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God be not our Governour, he hath no Laws? and so the Law of Nature and Scripture is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170314:71"/>4. Then man doth owe him no Obedience: for where there is no Ruler and Law, there is no obligation to Duty: and so man is not obliged by God to be pious, just, honest or sober; but if God will make him such, he will be such.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then it will follow, that there is no sin: All things that men do, are such as God doth move them to: but there being no Rector and Law, there can be no trangression.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence also it will follow, that there is no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is but the Habit or disposition to duty: for if there be no obligation to actual obedience, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is in vain, or is no moral good: for all moral good is denyed here at once.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And hence also it follows, that the Habits of Vice are nor culpable, because the Acts are not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful against God, there being no Law and Governour against whom they are committed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And Christianity is hereby most evidently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: For Christ cannot die for sin, nor redeem us from it, if there be no such thing; Nor can the Spirit mortifie it in us.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And hence it will follow, that all the Ministry and Ordinances are vain, and not of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If he have no Laws, there is no need of any to teach them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Hence also it will follow, that Scripture is false that pretendeth to be the Law of God, and tells us of all that's here denyed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And therefore there can be no pardon of sin: for where there is no Governour, there is no Law: and where no Law, there's no sin; and where no sin, the'rs none to pardon.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:170314:71"/>12. And then there needs no confession of sin, nor prayer for pardon, nor care or means to be used against it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Nor can any man ow God any thanks or praise for the pardon of his sins, if there be none.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And it will follow, that there is no punishment, for sin either in this life or in that to come, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecept what is inflicted, by Creatures for offences against Creatures.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And it will follow, that there is no Reward for the obedient; for if no Governor, Law and Duty, then no Reward.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And then there is no Judgement of God to be expected. For their is no possibility of Judgement where there is neither King, nor Subject, nor Law, nor Right, nor Wrong, not Reward, nor Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And it will follow that sin is as good as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and a wicked man as good and happy as an honest man: For nothing that men do is morally evill, and all things Equally, Physically good, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Physical Being, and God even as Physicall Governour is the chief cause, and therefore the effect cannot but be good, nor can there be an evill man in the world.</p>
               <p n="18">18. It will follow, that there are no Devils: for they could break no Law, nor do any evil, but the good that God, or rather the superior Intelligences made them do.</p>
               <p n="19">19. In a word, it hence followeth, that man is but a beast, that is, necessitated by Objects, and not a free agent governed by Laws.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And because I would make them twenty, let
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170314:72"/> this be the last: It followeth hence, that (God being not our Rector, and Law-giver, and so their being no sin against him) if the Governors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth shall hang or banish those that hold this traiterous opinion against the God of Heaven, and divulge it, or if any man that meets them, cudgel them, it is no sin against God, nor doth he need to fear any punishment for it from God.</p>
               <p>By this time you see what those men say, that deny the Soveraignty of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 26. God is the end, as well as the beginning of the divine Monarchy of the world.</q>
               <p>Of this by the way, I spake before. He is his own end, so far as he may be said to have an end; (which is not as man, that is imperfect, and without his end, while he is using meanes to attain it) and he is our cheif end, on the grounds and in the sense before explained. The appearance of his glory, and the fulfilling of his Will, being the highest Universal good. Should the end be lower then the beginning, a multitude of absurdities would follow; This end therefore is principally to be respected by men of all degrees.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 27. It is the reasonable Creatures only that are the Subjects of Gods Kingdom.</q>
               <p>Other Creatures are no more subjects, then sheep and horses are subjects of any Prince: They are the matter of as proper Dominion, (I mean <hi>Propriety)</hi> as Men; and are our Provision and Possessions: but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170314:72"/> they are not capable of subjection, for want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Free-will. They are as properly ordered by Gods <hi>Physical Government,</hi> as men are, but not <hi>by his Moral Policy,</hi> which is the Governement that now we treat of.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 28 All men as men are the subjects of Gods Kingdom, as to Obligation and Duty, and God will not ask the consent of any man to be so obliged.</q>
               <p>For Gods Kingdom is not constituted primarily by Contract, but his <hi>Right</hi> resulting immediately from his being our Creator, and so our <hi>Owner,</hi> our Obligation is founded in our being his Creatures, and his <hi>Own.</hi> The most absolute slave imaginable, cannot be so much obliged to you antecedently to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as man is unto his Creator, from whom he is, and hath all that he hath.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 29. He that consenteth not to Gods Soveraignty, and is not a voluntary Subject, shall be nevertheless obliged, both to Subjection (or that consent) and to Obedience, and to punishment in case of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but he can have no right to the Priviledges or Benefits of a subject, and so doth make himself worse then a slave, by being a Rebel.</q>
               <p>He that is born under the most Absolute Lord, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by his own will exempt himself from his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If he could make Gods Laws not obligatory, and himself no Debtor to God for his subjection and obedience, then might he depose his Soveraign at his pleasure. And most would take this as a readier
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170314:73"/> way to their sensual content and safety, to repeal the Law, and depose their King, to save them the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and labour of obeying him, and be from under his Judgement and punishments. No man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire benefits or priviledges by his vice: The Law supposeth that a mans faults may not advantage him. But to deny consent to the Soveraingnty of God, and to deny our own Obedience, would be our fault. But <hi>Benefits</hi> we can claim no right to, if we consent not to them and to the terms on which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. No man can plead for that which he refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: nor can he plead against another for not doing him good against his Will. Though we may offend God, yet we cannot injure man, by not doing him the good that he refuseth. And the greatest blessings of the Kingdom of God, are such as a Refuser is not capable of; Nor is he capable, while such, of the Duties of a Subject. And therefore though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exempt himself from obligation and punishment by dissent, yet may he deprive himself of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Soveraign, and forfeit all his hopes of the benefits</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 30. God therefore doth not beg authority by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for our consent, nor is it in the power of man by consenting to make him King, or by Dissenting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him, as to his Right and his actuall Legislation, Judgment and Execution: But it is in his power to make himself a Rebel, and so fall under the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law; and therefore Consent is required to our benefit as a condition, and as the necessary cause of our following Obedience: but as no cause or Conveyer of governing Authority to God.</q>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170314:73"/>
               <p>A man would think the earth should never have bred a man that would contradict this truth that is in his wits. For by so doing God is pulled down, and man set over him, or made a beast, and all morality (as by the former opinion) overthrown. But Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> in his <hi>Oceana,</hi> pag. 16. makes God but the <hi>Proposer,</hi> and the <hi>people the Resolvers or Confirmers of all their Laws, and saith, [they make him King,</hi> Deut. 19, <hi>They reject or depose him as Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and Elect Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7.] adding <hi>[The Power therefore which the people had to depose even God himself as he was Civil Magistrate, leaveth little doubt, but that they had power to have rejected any of those Laws confirmed by them throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They could <hi>violate</hi> a Law, and deny obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it; but they could not nullifie it, or prevent, or destroy its obligation. So they could be Rebels against God, but they could not so reject the duty of voluntary subjection, nor escape the punishment of Rebellion. One single person may thus reject God and his Laws at any time, (to his cost) as well as the Major Vote of the people. Its a lamentable case, that such blind persons that know not such things as these, should so perversely trouble the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth with their loathsom obtruded fancies. Mans <hi>consent</hi> doth not make God <hi>King,</hi> nor his <hi>dissent</hi> depose him, as to his Power, or the cheif part of his <hi>actual Government: He will be K. in spight</hi> of his proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemies: and he will make his <hi>Laws;</hi> and those <hi>Laws</hi> shall actually oblige; and men shall be <hi>guilty,</hi> that first consent not to be Subjects, and then <hi>obey</hi> not: and they <hi>shall be judged as Rebels,</hi> (Luk. 19. 17.)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170314:74"/> and the Judgement <hi>executed:</hi> Only their consent is, 1. A proper Cause of their own Obedience. 2. And a Condition <hi>sine qua non</hi> of their Interest in the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</hi> A little Power will serve a man to be come a Rebel, and be hanged. Will you see the face of this Gentlemans opinion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The world by dissenting may make God no God, that is, no Governor of the world: and so he holdeth his Government on our wills. 2. if his Doctrine be true, the Law of nature is no Law, till men consent to it. 3 At least where the Major Vote can carry it, Atheism, Idolatry, Murder, Theft, Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no sins against God. 4. Yea, no man sinneth against God, but he that consenteth to his Laws. 5. The people have greater Authority or Government then God. 6. Rebellion is sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power in the multitude. 7. Dissenters need not fear any Judgement or punishment from God. 8. Cannibals and Atheists are free-men, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to Gods Goverment. 9. Men owe not any Subjection, Duty, or Obedience to God at all unless they make themselves Debtors by consent. 10. The troublesome work of self-denying obedience, and all the danger of punishmenr here, and hereafter may be avoided easily by denying Gods soveraignty and deposing him, and no man need to be damned if he will but deny to be a Subject of God.</p>
               <p>These are the apparent Consequences of the Doctrines of Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> if he will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood according to the open meaning of his words: But if he will tell us that by [their Power of making God King, or deposing him, and of resolving on, and confirming, or rejecting his Proposals,] he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170314:74"/> meant only a power of voluntary subjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their absolute Lord and King, and of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Laws, or else a Power of Rebelling, Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and perishing, he will turn some of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and compassion into laughter, but his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage will we not imitate.</p>

               <p>HAving spoken of the <hi>CONSTITUTION</hi> of the Kingdom of God, I shall proceed to speak of the <hi>ADMINISTRATION</hi> thereof.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 35. God as the Soveraign Ruler of manking hath given him the Law of nature, commonly called the Morall Law, to be the Rule of his obedience.</q>
               <p n="1">1. The Law of nature in the primary most proper sence, is to be found <hi>in natura rerum,</hi> in the whole Creation that is objected to our Knowledg, as it is a Glass in which we may see the Lord, and much of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170314:76"/> Will; and as it is a Signifier of that Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our duty. 2. The Law of nature is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time taken for that Disposition or Aptitude that there is in mans nature to the actuall knowledg of these naturally revealed things, especially some clear and greatest Principles, which almost all the world dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. 3. And it is sometime taken for the Actual knowledge of those plain and common Principles. 4. And sometime for the Actual knowledge of all that meer Nature doth reveal. When I say God hath given man this law of nature, I mean, both that he hath made an Impress of his minde upon the Creation, and set us this Glass to see himself, and much of our Duty in, &amp; also that he hath given to the very nature of man a Capacity of perceiving what is thus revealed, and a disposition especially to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the more obvious Principles; so that by ordinary helps, they will be quickly known; and the rest may be known if we be not wanting to our selves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 36. This Law of Nature commandeth us much duty, to God directly, to our selves, to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in their private and publike capacities.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 37. The sum of the dutie commanded towards God, is to love him with all our hearts: more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it is, that we most highly esteem, honour, reverence, believe and trust him, and adhere to him in love, and seek him, depend upon and serve him with all our powers and faculties: worshipping him according to his nature and revealed will, and using
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170314:76"/> honourably his Name, and devoting to his special worship a fit proportion of our time.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 38. Our duty towards our selves, is an ordinate Love of our selves, and care of our bodies, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of our souls, for the great ends of our Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Redemption.</q>
               <p>There was the less said of this in Scripture, and the Decalogue, because it is written so deep in nature, and hath so great advantage in our natural desire to be happy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 39. Our duty towards our Neighbour as such, is to love him as our selves, that is, to love him with an Impartiall Love, not drawing from him to our <hi>selves,</hi> by an inordinate selfishness: which must be expressed about his Life, Chastity, Estate, Honour, and any thing that is his: Godliness, Soberness, and Righteousness, are the general Titles of all these three.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 40. Besides these Natural Laws which are promulgate to all, God hath a Law of Grace, and hath many Positive Laws; and both sorts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 41. God hath appointed an orderly course by the mission of fit persons as his Messengers to promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, preach, and explain these Laws, both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and supernatural Revelation to the World; and to command their obedience, and exhort them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and it is the duty of the hearers to learn, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170314:77"/> obey, yea, and the duty of those that have not the Gospel, to enquire after it, and seek it, according to the measure of that light they have, which giveth them intimation of its being.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 42. God hath appointed both in Nature and Scripture, that the world be divided into Rulers and Ruled, Officers and meere Subjects; and that the Officers Govern under him, by Authority deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, and the people obey them as his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And he hath not left it to the choice of the Nations whether they will have Government or not</q>
               <p>Those Politicians therefore that say a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in its own nature doth not participate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good or evil, but is a thing neither commanded nor forbidden, doe fundamentally erre in their Politicks. It is possible for one or few persons in extraordinary cases to be disobliged from living under any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (But the Cases are so rare, that it is not one of many millions of persons that is ordinarily in that case.) But to man-kind in common, it is made a duty to live in this order of Government, where it may be had. He therefore that should think he is born a Freeman, and therefore will maintain his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and be Governed by none, (being not a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour himself) doth sin against God, in violating his Order, as Souldiers should do in an Army that would have no Officers, nor be commanded by any but the General. This is easily proved, for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nature immediately makes an inequality in our procreation and birth, and subjecteth children
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170314:77"/> to their Parents as their undoubtedly rightful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nature doth make such inequality of persons in point of sufficiency and endowments, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitateth Government, while some are unable or un-apt to subsist comfortably without the Government of others: And therefore even in state of marriage Nature subjecteth the weaker sexe to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the stronger. And its natural for persons of weak understandings, and other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to have some that are wise and able to Govern them, lest they be destitute of help and left to ruine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nature hath made man a sociable creature, both by <hi>Necessity,</hi> and <hi>Inclination;</hi> and therefore must be in ordered societies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nature hath made man a lover of man, and so far as he is good, so far to be Communicative: and theresore the wisdom and strength that any doe excell in, is for the good of others; and all things must be so ordered that the whole may be the better for the gifts of the several parts, and the weak for the strong; and therefore there must be Governed societies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Providence keepeth some in such necessitie of others, as requireth their relief and protection, and Government. Some by paucity are insufficient for their own defence: some by the proximity of potent Enemies and Thieves: some by the scituation of their Countries, and some by want.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The vitiousness of men hath made Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now of double necessitie, to what it would be if man we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e innocent, when men are Wolves to one another, and the weaker can keep nothing that the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170314:78"/> stronger hath a minde to, and no mans life can be safe from cruelty and revenge; when there is so much backwardness to vertue and well doing, and so much vice to be restrained, it is now no more question whether Government be naturally necessary, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection a duty; then whether Physitians be necessary in a rageing plague, or food in a famine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Experience tells us that Gods work, or our preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cannot be well carried on without it; without it the world would be a confused crowd. It would dishonour the Soveraign Ruler, if his Kingdom were turned into a tumultuous rabble, God doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, that is without sutable means, exercise his Government by himself. He could have easily done it: but it is the beauty and perfection of his Kingdom that there be diversity of Orders. He could lighten the world without the Sun: but he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen rather to communicate so much of his Splendor to a Creature: He will have men like our selves to be his Officers among men, as fittest for our familiar converse. And What would a Nation be without Government, but a company of miserable men, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and killing one another, what would an Army be without Commanders? and how would they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves against the enemies.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Law of Nature requireth Justice; that it may goe well with the good, and ill with the evill; and that vertue be encouraged, and wickedness pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: therefore it requireth that there be a course of Government in the world to this end.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is Government among the very Angels and Divels: therefore it is not to be avoided or thought a thing indifferent among men.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170314:78"/> All places have some Order.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Analogicall Government in the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosme, man, doth prove a Natural need and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Government. The Intelect in man is made to guide, and the Will to Command, &amp; all the inferiour faculties to obey: shewing us that in soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties the <hi>Wise</hi> should <hi>guide,</hi> the <hi>Good</hi> should command, and the <hi>Strong</hi> and all the rest should execute and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. An ungoverned man is a mad man, or a bad man.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The great disparity that is among all Creatures in the frame of Nature, intimateth the beauty of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly Political disparity. Look but to the Sun and Moon, and Stars. and see their inequality and Order. Beasts differ in strength, and the very stones of the field are not of equal bigness and shape. The sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ants have an Order among them, and a Hive of Bees are a Natural Common-wealth.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 43. As the difference of our faculties, and our personal self Government, so also Domestical, Political, and Ecclesiastical Order of Government and subjection, are the Institutions of God, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Laws.</q>
               <p n="1">1. The well governing of a mans selfe (which is taught by Theological Ethicks) is both necessary to his own felicity, and a principal requisite to the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beauty, and felicity of the societies, that consist of individual persons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Domestical Order is commanded of God, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in nature directly, as the Rule of Parents, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Children: partly by the intervention of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170314:79"/> contracts for the application of the Law to the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual persons, as in the Relations of Husband and Wife, of Master and servant, where note, that in the first, it is one thing for Nature to give the Law, and another thing for Nature to produce the person: Nature as procreative brings forth the Childe? from whence the mutual Relations result: but it is Nature partly as Indicative of Gods will, and partly as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing us with Principles or Dispositions of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (that is, as a Law) that obliged Children to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, as Parents to Govern: so also the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Scripture is it that imposeth on <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> the duty of obeying, as on Husbands and Masters the care and duty of Governing; but it is <hi>Choice</hi> that determineth of the <hi>Persons</hi> that are to <hi>Rule</hi> and to <hi>obey,</hi> that <hi>this</hi> or that shall be the <hi>man</hi> or the <hi>woman</hi> that shall be a Husband or Wife is of choice: and that this or that shall be the <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> and also (these being free Relations) it is here of choice, whether they will be Married or not, and servants or not. (To the world in general, the Relations are necessary, but not to every individual person.) But whether the Husband shall govern, and the wife obey, and whether the Master shall govern, and the servant obey, this is not of choice: so that if they should by Contract agree, that the wife shall not be subject to the Husband, it were <hi>ipso facto</hi> null, as being contrary to the divine Institution or Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As many Families cohabiting without Political or Civil Government, would want that which is is necessary to their own Wel-fare and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. As an Empire is divided into several Provinces, or Principalities, so God hath made it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170314:79"/> necessary that the world be distributed into many particular Common-wealths. An Universal humane Monarchy is impossible, it being beyond the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any one so to govern; (the more to blame the Pope for pretending to it) God only can govern all the world. But men as his Officers have their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces, which in due subordination to him and his Laws, must be governed by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because men have immortal souls to save, and an everlasting life of happinesse to attain, or misery to suffer, and God himself hath a final Judgment to pass on all according to his Laws, and because men are rational free Agents that must by knowledge and choice be brought into a fitness for feliciry, and be kept in acceptable obedience to their Soveraign; therefore hath he appointed Pastors to teach and guide the people in the way of life, and to acquaint them with his Laws, and his future Judgement, and in free ordered Churches to lead them in the publick Worship of God, and exercise that spirituall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by his Word, which shall preserve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his holinesse in the world, and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his servants and the rebellious, and lead his people towards perfection.</p>

As God is the universal King, and hath a universal Kingdom and Law, so doth he in this life exercise himself some part of his executive power; in protecting his faithfull Subjects, encouraging the good, and punishing offenders by himself, and by the Ministry of Angels: But his full Universal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be after this world, when all shall be finally sentenced by him to everlasting Joy or Misery. <hi>so much of Gods UNIVERSAL ADMINISTRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.</hi>

               <p>Many Definitions you may find in politicks, almost each one having one of his own, though most of them to the same sence. And therefore if I use not any of theirs in all the terms, I am as excusable as they.</p>

A Common-Wealth <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogically so called, is [The order of a Civil body, consisting of Governours and Subjects intended for their corporal Wel-fare, but acknowledging not Gods Soveraignty, nor intending spiritual and everlasting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The absence of any one of these Essential Ingredients, makes their Government ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. If it want either Moral-dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as absolute Soveraign, or the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his great Universal Laws which must be the Fundamentals to their own, or if they intend not any spiritual and everlasting good to the societies, or intend not the honour and pleasing of God, but begin and end their Government with their carnal selves, this is not simply or properly a Common-wealth, but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> and Analogically; even no more then an Ideot is a reasonable man. Its agreed on by Politicians, that a Company of Robbers that choose them a King, are no Common-wealth, because they deviate from the Universal fundamental Laws; Much less is a Company of Rebels a Common-wealth that seek both the subversion of King and Kingdom: and so want both the necessary Beginning, Means and End. And a Justice of Peace or Judge may as well have Power, when they have renounced their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Soveraign, and Loyalty to him, as a King or any other can have just Power when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Allegiance or subjection to God.

The form of a Common-wealth is the Relation of Soveraign and Subjects to each other; The Subject matter is a civil body, or Community of Gods Subjects: The Relate and Correlate are the Soveraign and the Subjects: The fundamentum being the chief controverted point shall be spoken of by it self.

One natural Subject may have many Relations: As the same man may be a King, a Generall, a Husband, a Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so he may be a King of many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, The Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was not the same with the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Many Kingdoms may have different Constitutions, one of them have an Emperor, another a limitted King, another a more limitted, and yet all have the same man. And as he is the Emperor, Duke or Prince of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, he is not the same Civil person, as he is, as King of another: And that many natural persons may be one <hi>Civil</hi> person, shall be further shewed when we come to the <hi>species</hi> of Government.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 51. The people as people are not the Soveraign Power, neither as natural persons aggregate, nor as having the chief Propriety and strength, nor as any way endowed by God with governing Authority: And therefore the distinction of some Politicians (Papists and Protestants) of <hi>Majestas realis &amp; personalis,</hi> and the Assertion of the Popular, that the People are the real Soveraign, or have the <hi>Majestatem Realem,</hi> (unless the constitution of that individual Common-wealth shall give it them) is false, and not to be endured.</q>
               <p>If the people any otherwise then by particular Constitutions, (by fundamental Contracts) be the Soveraigns, or have any Governing civil power, it must be either by nature, by accident, or by divine Institution: But none of these wayes: therefore not at all.</p>
               <p>That they have none by nature is plain, in that they are not by nature a Community or Aggregate Body. And when they are so, they have naturally no Soveraignty, as I prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where there is no Common-wealth, there is no Soveraignty: but in a meer Community or Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of men before any Contracts, or voluntary Constitution, there is no Common-wealth: therefore there is no Soveraignty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. if a meer Aggregation of natural men did make a Common-wealth and Soveraignty, then a Fare or Market might be a Common wealth: or a ship laden with Passengers or a Prison full of Captives, or an invading Army of enemies. But the Consequent is confessed a falshood, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>If meer nature make an Aggregate body of men to be a Common-wealth, or to have a real Majesty, (or Soveraignty) then every aggregate Body of men are a Commonwealth, and have that Soveraignty, but the consequent is false: for there are Schools, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Societies of Merchants, and many other Corporations and Societies that are no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If nature make a meer Aggregation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of men to be a Commonwealth, or to have Real Majesty, then men may be a Common-wealth, and have such Majesty without, yea, and against their own consent: (For there may be a Community of Men that consent not to be a Common-wealth.) But the Consequent is false, therefore so is the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will follow also, that no End intended by the people is necessary to the being of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; (For men may meet, or cohabit, or associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and combine for severall ends.) But the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is false against the nature of all such Relations and Associations, therfore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If nature make the people Soveraignes, then <hi>either</hi> all conjunctly, or a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Not <hi>All:</hi> For, 1. Where there is no Subject, there is no Soveraign: But if all conjunctly are feigned to be the Soveraign, there would be no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: therefore, &amp;c. The Relate cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Correlate. 2. If all must be conjunct in the Soveraignty, no one would be punished, nor any righted: for every man would be judge in his own cause, and every Delinquent would have a negative
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170314:83"/> voice in his own sentence, and no Murderer would suffer, till he, and all his friends consent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be the <hi>Major Vote</hi> that is affirmed to have the Soveraignty; I answer, 1. Nature giveth no such Power: There is nothing in nature to tell us that 1001 should have Power of Governing (and so of the lives) of 999. 2. Nature giveth them not so much as an <hi>Aptitude,</hi> much less Authority and Right. 1. The <hi>Aptitude</hi> is in a <hi>Supereminency of Wisdom, Goodness and Power:</hi> but nature giveth none of these, much less all to the <hi>Major Vote;</hi> therefore it gives not to the <hi>Major Vote</hi> so much as an <hi>Aptitude</hi> for Government. 1. The world knows that knowledge followeth not the <hi>Major Vote.</hi> A few Learned experienced men, may be wiser then a thousand times as many of the Vulgar. 2. And their Vertue will be defective as their Wisdom is. 3. And (though Power be more for execution then for proper Government, yet) it is known that ten strong men may beat twenty weak ones, and that an Army of 30000 doth often beat an Army of 40000.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, Nature usually denyeth the Aptitude for Government to the Major Vote. For, 1. They are ordinarily most imprudent, wanting the natural and acquired parts that others have. 2. They are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usally most vicious: The most are seldom the best, in the Best Countreys of the world. 3. They are commonly divided, and hardly kept in Unity among themselves; and therefore are unfit to be the Center of Unity to the rest.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If Nature place the Soveraignty in an aggregate body of the people, then either in a certain number,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170314:84"/> or an uncertain. Not on a Certain Number: for nature limiteth it not to such a number, nor doth any affirm it: Not to an uncertaine number, for then every member that is added to the Common-wealth may possibly alter the bent of the whole Soveraignty. <hi>E. G.</hi> If it be half Protestants, and half Papists, and one Papist be admitted into the company, he will give the Papists the <hi>Major Vote.</hi> And thus the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies may at any time subvert them, and the society will wheel about like the Weather-cock, one party making Laws, and the next Repealing them, as each can get the <hi>Major Vote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. If Nature do make the people the real <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> or give them any Governing power, then it is either because they are the <hi>wisest, the best, or the strongest:</hi> But it is by none of these: For, 1. It is proved, that ordinarily they are void of the two first and oft of the last. 2. If not, yet they are but an Aptitude, and not a <hi>Title.</hi> 3. Else if one Nation be wiser or better then the rest, all should be subject to them; or if an enemy stronger then we set foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our soil, they are naturally our Governors. And 4. Then there can be no Injustice, if strength or wit may carry it: for he that cheats or beats ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath Right to all he hath, or if any man can prove too hard for the Prince, his strength would be his Title.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Nature had given the chief Governing Power to the people, then God would not have gone contrary to this in the institution mentioned in his word: But he hath gone contrary to it, (as shall be shewn) therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>he Nations of the earth be contrary to it: for that which is of nature, is most common to naturall men. But no men that I hear of, are Governed by the people as set over them by meer nature: And few take them to have a naturall aptitude: and therefore most places have Monarchy or Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Power of Governing a Common-wealth is not a natural thing, but a Right that must come by Commission from a Superior; therefore it is nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly conveyed by meer nature: therefore the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude have it not by nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if they have it not by nature, then either by some supervenient Accident, or by Contract: If by Accident, either by Propriety in Riches, or by acquired Prudence or by Conquest. But none of these ways can it belong to the Community, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Vote, as such.</p>
               <p>For. 1. A few men many be richer then many, and have Dominion of more Lands and Cattle. 2. And this giveth no man Right to be the Governour of others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Acquired Prudence is but an Aptitude, and not a <hi>Title;</hi> and yet it is such as the multitude are void of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They cannot be said to be Conquerors of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or of the minor part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nothing therefore remaineth to be pleaded for the popular Soveraignty, but Contract, or <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> And if Contract do the deed, it is either a Contract about this very <hi>form</hi> and <hi>end</hi> in question, or about some <hi>other.</hi> 1. If about <hi>another,</hi> it cannot give them Power in this. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Though the people have not any SOveraignty or Governing Authority as people, yet have they a certain <hi>Right to that Common good</hi> which is the <hi>End of Government,</hi> and each man hath that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> in his life and faculties, and Children, and Estate, and Honour, that no Rulers may unjustly take these from him; which <hi>Right</hi> as it is secured partly by the Law of Nature, partly by other Laws or Institutions of God, and partly by the specifying Fundamental Contracts of the Common-wealth, and commonly called <hi>[The Liberties of the People]</hi> and the just security of these Liberties, is it that some Authours have mistaken for <hi>Majestas Realis</hi> and a popular Authority to Government</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 53. Majesty or Soveraignty is the Highest Power of Governing the Common-wealth, and the Fountain of all inferiour Power.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 54. As Power or Authority is <hi>Jus Regendi,</hi> a Right to Govern, so the Soveraigns power in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial consisteth in the Only Right of making the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Laws of the Common-wealth, and conveying Authority to inferiour Governours, and having the Highest Power of Judgement from which there is no appeal to any but God.</q>
               <p n="1">1. Authority is oft taken in other senses: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the effective Interest that any man hath in the esteem of another, either for his Learning, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodness, and Fidelity, Riches or Strength. And so there is <hi>Authoritas Affirmantis, Docentis,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170314:86"/> Suadentis, Testantis, Minantis, Promittentis, &amp;c.</hi> according to mens several Interests. And Power is oft taken for meere strength. But it is Civil Power or Authority that we are here to speak of, which is nothing else but <hi>[Jus Regendi] A Right to Govern with an obligation thereto:</hi> (except in God the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Soveraign who can be obliged by none) As Government is an Honour and Dignity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth obedience from Inferiours, so it is <hi>[A Right:]</hi> But as it is an act of obedience it self to a Superiour Power that commandeth it as his work, so it is from an <hi>Obligation</hi> of that Superiour which is God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any of the aforesaid Power of Legislation and Judgement be reserved to the people, they have it not as people, but as participating in the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
               <p>And if the King shall by Law or Custome have the sole Title or name of Soveraigne or Supream, and yet either Lords, or Senate, or people shall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in the said Legislation, or Highest Judgement, they so far participate in the Soveraignty. For it is not the <hi>Honorary names,</hi> but the <hi>thing</hi> that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>quoad exercitium</hi> a Soveraigne may refuse to exercise his highest Judgement, and cause it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to be done by Judges, and the people may limit him therein. Legislation therefore is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est work of Soveraignty; (of which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.)</p>
               <p>When a Soveraign giveth power to Corporations to make Laws they are but By-Laws, subordinate to the Laws of the Common-wealth, &amp; are about particular
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170314:86"/> matters, and therefore are not Common-wealth Laws, but Corporation-Laws: And yet they are Originally the Soveraignes Laws, in that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came from him, though Proximately they are their Laws that made them. But if he should Depute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the power of making Common-wealth-Laws, he should depute him to an act of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 55. Soveraignes are some perpetual, that is for life, and some temporary, or for a limited time; And therefore Politicians should not make it Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Soveraignty to be perpetual.</q>
               <p>Time here cannot alter the general Nature of the Power. It is really the Right of Chief or Soveraign Rule, if it be but for a year or day. As the Major or Bayliff of a Corporation is truly a Magistrate though but for a year, as well as those that have the place for life, so is a Soveraign. The Duration is not essential to the Power. As he is a King that may be cut off by Death the next week after he is Crowned, so is he that receiveth the Crown but for a limited time. If he take it for two hundred years, (which is above the usual life of man) if he should so long live, he is as truly King, as if no years were nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if so, then no man can fix a term between two hundred years, and two hundred dayes, or two days, which must make our essential difference. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Dictator is a temporary Monarch.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 56. The Soveraign is above all the Humane Laws of the Common-wealth; that is, he hath power to make Laws and to repeale them, correct them, adde to them, dispense with them, and pardon the breach of them to particular persons, and as a Soveraign is not bound to keep them by obedience him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor to suffer by them.</q>
               <p>The reason of this, is evident from the nature of Soveraignty and of Laws. He that is highest hath no Higher to obey: Laws are but the significations of the Law-givers <hi>will,</hi> and therefore can go no further then his will. He commandeth others and not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. It is proper to a Subject to be obliged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by a propet Law. And therefore if King, Lords, and Commons that had the Reall Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here among us, had broken a Law that threatneth death, they had not forfeited their lives by it: nor is there any Superiour to be their Legall Judge.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 57. Yet is not the Soveraign free from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Laws of God, nor from the Obligation of the Fundamental contracts of the Common-wealth, nor of any of his publick promises: nor may he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with his own Laws, (much less make Laws) against Gods Laws or the Common-good.</q>
               <p>But for violating these, he hath none to judge him as Governour but God: if the people question him as violating the constitution, and destroying the Common-wealth, it must not be as Subjects, nor as his Soveraign: For <hi>Subjects as such,</hi> must <hi>obey,</hi> and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170314:87"/> not Rule: and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> they have none. But if they do it, it must be as <hi>Parties</hi> in the <hi>Contract,</hi> vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the violated Contracts upon natural self pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suming grounds, as men kill their Enemies in Wars or Duells, for their own defence: which is not as Rulers of the Enemies where they kill. But whether this may be done, or in what cases, must be spoken of more distinctly by it selfe anon.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 58. But it is possible (how fit I dispute not) that the same natural person that hath the chief part of the Soveraign Power, may be both Soveraign and subject in severall respects, and so have several civil capacities, and then he may as subject be obliged by the same Laws which as Soveraign he makes, and may be punished accordingly; that is, If by the Constitution and by his own consent (in receiving a power on such terms) he be thus subjected.</q>
               <p>A Prince may by the <hi>Constitution</hi> be obliged to be responsible in his Courts of Justice, for Debts, or Wrongs, or Crimes and subjected to more or lesse penalties. But he is not thus obliged to duty, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>as soveraign,</hi> but <hi>as subject:</hi> and therefore it is supposed that he have not the total <hi>soveraignty;</hi> but in point of <hi>Judgment,</hi> so much of it be committed to the highest Judicature as shall put them in a capacity to judge him. And if the same person (natural) might not be subject that hath part in the Soveraignty, then in Aristocracies and Democracies, many would be from under Laws. But though this be <hi>possible,</hi> yet is it <hi>unusuall and dangerous</hi> to the Common-wealth, that any Judicature should have power to <hi>behead the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170314:88"/> Common-wealth:</hi> and that the <hi>Highest Judgement</hi> be in the hands of any that have not the <hi>Highest Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power,</hi> and that to be exercised on the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators:</hi> and that a <hi>Subject</hi> (in all other respects) should have power to judge his <hi>Soveraign to death;</hi> To be responsible about matters of <hi>propriety</hi> is not so unfit. But that the Honour or Life of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign (whether a single Monarch, or a Senate, or both in mixt Governments) should be in the power of inferiour Judges, is unmeet and unsafe to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 59. The existence of the Natural Person of the Soveraign is not necessary to the existence of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</q>
               <p>And therefore its said that <hi>Rex non moritur.</hi> For when the person is dead, <hi>(e. g.</hi> in an Elective Monarchy) the <hi>Species</hi> lives in the Constitution, and in the minds and wills of all the people, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will choose a successor.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 61. Subjects are either <hi>Imperfect,</hi> and only such by <hi>Obligation</hi> and not consent, <hi>(as are Rebels)</hi> or <hi>plenary</hi> by consent.

               <p>The reason of the difference is sometimes from the difference of expressions of consent, but usually from personall differences of <hi>Aptitude</hi> and Capacity: some being children, Idiots, servants, poor, and so depending upon others, and unfit to have a hand in Government.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 63. It is not the defect of secret intentions of the Ends of Government, that can nullifie the being of a Common-wealth; but if the Common good be not the professed end, it is null.</q>
               <q>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the several sorts of Common-wealths.</head>
               <p>HAving spoken of the Universal Kingdom, and next in general of particular subordinate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, that God hath by institution made the parts of it; I must First speak of the <hi>CONSTITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,</hi> and next of the <hi>ADMINISTRATION</hi> of these. And about the <hi>Constitution</hi> I shall first speak of the <hi>MODES</hi> (or <hi>SPECIES</hi> as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called) and then of the <hi>Individuation.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 65. God hath not in his Universal Lawes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained the Nations of the world to any one <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> of Government, but left it as a variable thing to be determined according to the condition of each people, whether one or many shall have the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty under him.</q>
               <p>There is a twofold diversity of Governments: One is in the <hi>Persons Ruling;</hi> Another is in the <hi>Matter</hi> of Government: whether the former do deserve the name of <hi>Specification</hi> or not, it hath by Custome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that name: And so <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracie,</hi> and <hi>Democracie</hi> are called the distinct <hi>Species</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments or Common-wealths. In the <hi>Matter</hi> of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170314:89"/> Government there is difference, in that some have greater power, and some have less: some Soveraigns are limited to certain <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of power; and some are unlimited: and some limited more, and some less. And one would think this difference were as great as the former.</p>
               <p>I know some pretend to a Divine Institution for Monarchy, but they mean onely that it <hi>may</hi> from Scripture be proved to be <hi>best;</hi> but not that no other but it, is Lawfull. Thus <hi>Michael Hudson</hi> and others assert it to be <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> As for their pretences, that would make <hi>Democracie</hi> the onely Government that hath the stamp of God, I think them not worth the writing against.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 66. The true formal nature of a Common-weal is in every one of the Modes or Species now in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so that it is absurd to appropriate the Title of a Common-wealth to any one of them alone.</q>
               <p>Yet so do the new Popularists among us, calling <hi>Democracie</hi> only <hi>[a Common-wealth]</hi> which they should rather call <hi>[a Common-government]</hi> if it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no contradiction. The <hi>Constituting Matter</hi> of every Common-wealth is the <hi>Pars Imperans,</hi> and <hi>Pars subdita:</hi> the Governours and Subjects: and the <hi>forme</hi> is their <hi>Mutual Relation</hi> as respecting the End: the neerest End is Order, and the next the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples safety and welfare hereby maintained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; together with the Honour of the Governor: the more principal End is our present pleasing of God and honouring him, and the ultimate end is our more perfect everlasting pleasing him in our fruition
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170314:90"/> of him in glory. It is named <hi>Respublica</hi> a <hi>Common-weal,</hi> partly from the <hi>matter,</hi> because it is the publick Affaires that it is exercised about: and partly from the end, because it is the Common good that it is instituted for, and is to be intended. A Vicinity or Community, City or Society may be where there is no Common-wealth. Any Number of men in capacity are the remote subject of it. A City or Community drawn neerer by contract, are usually or oft the more neer subject of it. For usually some Contract disposeth them, and makes them a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or City, before they become a Common-wealth, or so it <hi>may</hi> do at least. Though <hi>some</hi> call it not a City till it be headed with a Governour, and so it is a Common-wealth. Its not the <hi>Attaining</hi> but the <hi>Intention</hi> or <hi>Tendencie</hi> of the Government to the <hi>Common-good</hi> that is essential to a Common-wealth. An accidentally unhappy Common-wealth hath yet the forme, and must have the name.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 67. The reason why God did not Universally by his Law tye all the World to One forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is because the difference of persons, times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, neighbours, &amp;c. may make one forme best to one people, and at one time, and place, that is worst to another Monarchy is best for some, Aristocracie to others, and Democracie to others.</q>
               <p>Some places may have fewer persons fit, and some more: some places may lie under the <hi>advantages</hi> of <hi>one</hi> man, or of <hi>many,</hi> or of the <hi>multitude,</hi> so as that they cannot live prosperously without pleasing them, and so submitting to them. In some places the people
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170314:90"/> are much addicted to <hi>One</hi> way, and in some to ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: some Common-wealths do most intend <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> and other <hi>Increase</hi> of Riches, or of <hi>Possessions</hi> by enlargement of their Territories. And Custom may do much.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 68. That is the best form of Government to this or that People, that all things considered, doth most powerfully tend to their spiritual and everlasting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and their Holiness, Obedience, and pleasing of God.</q>
               <p>Nothing more sure or clear, then that the ultimate end doth most put the due estimate on all the means. If Government be no means to this end, it is not good, desirable, nor of God: for if it be not to and for God, it is not from him. There is nothing in all the world that can be the Object of a humane Act, but the ultimate end, and the meanes thereto. If Government be neither, we have nothing to do with it: But if it be one (as certainly it is) it cannot be the end, and therefore must be a means: and if so, that is the best means which most tendeth to the attainment of the end.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the Common corporal Prosperity is the near and proper end, and therefore that must estimate the meanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Even that nearer end is it self but a means to our ultimate end; nor to be any further valued or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by a rational Creature, then it hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereto; and therefore that which hath no value it self, but what it hath as a means to the ultimate end, can convey no other to its subordinate means.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170314:91"/> Nothing more sure then that our ultimate end must turn the scales of our estimation of all means. A horse may be stronger then a man, and a dog sounder, and a Tree live longer here. The Turkish Dominion may have more riches, and Power, and larger Command then the English Common-wealth: But it is not therefore the happier: That which most advanceth the people to salvation, and keeps out sin, and keeps our holiness and pleaseth God, is the best Government. He that beleveth not this, is at the heart an Infidel. A prison with holiness and the favour of God, is better then all the Riches and Glory of the world without it: The comon cause of the Damnation of all that perish is the preferring of Riches, Honor, Pleasure, Liberty, and such fleshly accommodation before God and Glory. No men on earth therefore can more promote the Devils work, and the perdition of souls, then these that plead for corporall advantages in the framing of their Common-wealths against Gods interest, and the well-fare of mens souls! They too grosly play over again the game that the Devil playd with Christ that foiled him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. when he offered him all the Kingdoms and glory of the world, if he would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him. None but those that have forsaken God shall be so far forsaken by him as to follow these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Principles. We will not contrive our own adversity, nor refuse Prosperity when God affordeth it: But we must estimate all with respect to our ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end, and prefer the flames before a Crown when it is against this end.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170314:91"/>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 69. That is the best form of Government that most conduceth to the common safety of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of God, and the well-fare of his Universall Kingdom.</q>
               <p>The good of the world, and the whole body of Gods faithful Subjects is more to be lookt at, then the good of a particular Common-wealth. The same Principles that prove it sordid and impious to value our private personal prosperity before that of the Common-wealth, do prove it as bad to value the good of one Common-wealth before the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Kingdom of God on earth. If a people could live most prosperously to themselves in the state of some petty Republicks and Free-Cities, but yet are thereby uncapable of doing much for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or wel-fare of their brethren <hi>abroad,</hi> it is not the most desirable Government.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 70. At that is properly a Domination, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of servants, which is principally for the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers benefit, and that is a Common-wealth which is principally for the Common-benefit, so the more any form of Government tendeth to the Common-weal or Good of all, the more desirable it is; (supposing the two fore-mentioned conditions.)</q>
               <p>This also is plain, because the end still estimates the means. And as Millions are better then one and Gods interest more concerned in their wel-fare, so their wel-fare is more the end of the Common-wealth then his. The Prince in this respect is for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170314:92"/> the people, more then they for him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 71. Yet is the Honour of the Prince, as he is Gods Officer, and participateth of Authority derived from him, one part of the end of a Common-wealth, and not to be separated from the peoples benefit, in our intentions.</q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>M. Hudson</hi> maintaineth that this <hi>Honor of the Soveraign</hi> is the <hi>nobler end,</hi> and to be preferred before the peoples good. I think they are so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably linckt together, that we cannot fairly bring them into Competition or Dissention. Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in other respects is most in the people: though it is only the Rulers that participate of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power and Honor. <hi>Gods interest</hi> in the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Honor,</hi> is better then the <hi>Peoples prosperity as theirs: And Gods Interest</hi> in the <hi>Peoples Wel-fare,</hi> and the Worship and Obedience that he hath from them, is better then the <hi>Magistrates Honor as his own:</hi> And the peoples Wel-fare <hi>as their own,</hi> is better then the <hi>Magistrates honor as his own:</hi> There remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no question to be decided, but this, <hi>Whether Gods Interest in the Rulers honor, or in the peoples Wel-fare, must be preferred.]</hi> Which needs no further decision, because they are never to be separated, but both to be still regarded. Honor is commanded us to our Superiors in the fifth Commandment, and if any sin of theirs do make them uncaple of their own part in the honor, still Gods part must be secured, that is, when they are bad Rulers they must have the Honor of Rulers, though not of good Rulers, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth unto God: and if they cease to be Rulers,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170314:92"/> Magistracy ceaseth not, and therefore it must still be honoured, and God in it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 72. That form of Government is not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most for the common good; which giveth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power to the multitude, but that which provideth them with the greatest advantages to serve and please God, and help their Brethren.</q>
               <p>Let Satans slaves think the <hi>Highest</hi> are the <hi>Happiest,</hi> who are animated with <hi>Pride,</hi> and take the admiration, applause and submission of men to be their felicity: but none will think so that are not blinded with ambition: The befooled Admirers of the glittering vain Glory, and pomp of worldly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and greatnesse, do think a trouble and grievous burden a desirable thing, and part of their felicity. And therefore as every wicked, proud and sensual man would fain be highest, and the Ruler of all, so when such proud and wicked men write Politicks, no wonder if they animate their Writings from their own spirits and principles, and make that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est state to the people in which they may have most of Governing Dignity and Power which is far from Truth.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 73. The great burden and work of the Ruler, is the Principal thing to be lookt at in his office; and the Honor is but for the work sake, and for God that giveth him his Power? The people therefore are more beholden to a faithful Governor, then the Governor is to the people, and receive more from him, then he from them.</q>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:170314:93"/>
               <p>Most men believe not this, though it be most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, because Ambition and carnal Admiration of secular pomp doth bind their minds. But consider, 1. It is but one man, or a few that are the Receivers from the people, and it is the whole Community that receiveth from the Prince. 2. His cares and labors are far greater for them, then theirs for him or for the most part for themselves. He that never, was at Court, may easily know, what a miserable life it is (as to private pleasure) to have the care of a Common-wealth, and to have so many Expectants and Petitioners to satisfie, and of so contrary disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, interests &amp; expectations, where it is impossible for the wisest or richest Prince to satisfie or gratifie all, and unavoidably necessary to displease many, &amp; then to incur the passionate censures of those that are displeased: To have scarce time through multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of businesse to look to the health of their own bodies; nor do so much for their souls as they that are out of the crowd, and have opportunity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements. 3. And their lives are more in danger by the Plots and Passions of enemies and discontented men, then the Subjects are. 4. And worst of all, they stand in the most incommodious, dangerous station as to their own salvation: The Pomp of the world is potent to deceive, and the gteatness and multitude of Business to divert; and the words of flatterers to pervert, and their applause to puffe up; and carnal Interest to engage them against the mortifying Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and flesh displeasing ways of Christ: so that few great, noble and mighty are saved, and its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous heard for the rich and great to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So that I conclude, that for wicked men that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170314:93"/> believe not a life to come, and intend not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, but their own advancement, to scramble for a Crown, and clamber into honor, is no wonder, and accordingly they are like to use it. But if any good man, that knoweth what he doth, do accept of a station of so great work, and suffering, and danger, the people are more beholden to him, then he to them. Wise men know the weights of Crowns.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 74. Of all the three ordinary sorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Democracy is to most people, and usually the worst.</q>
               <p>Let us first know what the sorts are that we speak of, and then prove the Assertion. And first I will not meddle with Domination, which looketh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to the Princes ends, &amp; but consequently at the common good, but only at the Monarchy thats cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led] <hi>A Kingdom.]</hi>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 75. 1. A Kingdom is a Common-wealth that hath one person only for its Soveraign, the end of whose Constitution and Administration is the common good.</q>
               <p>The very Title of <hi>Rex,</hi> a King, is the most modest and convenient that a Soveraign can have: for it signifieth but <hi>one that ruleth, directeth or guideth,</hi> whereas <hi>Imperator,</hi> an <hi>Emperour,</hi> signifying a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> is fitted to the General of an Army, and of too high importance for him that Ruleth by Laws. And <hi>Dominus</hi> a Lord, in its proper signification, is, higher then that, and signifieth one that hath a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170314:94"/> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Disposing of,</hi> as well as Rulling the persons and things that are under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ordereth them for himself as his own. A <hi>Protector</hi> is a name that I may not now descant on; but I may boldly say, that a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Prince, Rex, &amp; Princeps</hi> are lower as to pretension, and have in them the least appearance of Arrogancy, or sound of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, and are most suited to a moderate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 76. The Corruption of Monarchy is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tyranny</hi> which is when the <hi>One</hi> that is appointed to rule for the Common-good, doth destroy the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, or subject it to his private interest.</q>
               <p>Some call him also a Tyrant that wants a just Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and so distinguish the Tyrant that wanteth Title from him that abuseth it. But, 1. No man hath a Right to proper Tyranny, or to destroy the common good. 2. The other is more usually and fitly called an <hi>Invader, Intruder,</hi> or <hi>Usurper;</hi> and so let him keep his name.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 77. Aristo acy is a Common-wealth that's Governed by some of the best for the Common-good.</q>
               <p>The Corruption of it is called <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> which is the confusion of the Community, when some of the strongest or richest, but not the best to get posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the supream Government, and manage it for their private Interests, and not for the common good. If they be chosen by full Suffrage, yet it may
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170314:94"/> be an Oligarchie, as well as by Invasion: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and abuse may corrupt the form.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 78. Democracy is a Common-wealth where the Soveraign Power is in all, or the Major Vote of the people to be exercised for the Common-good.</q>
               <p>Some popular forms admit all the multitude to vote in Government without distinction: Most are wiser, and admit only persons thus and thus qualified, that have such Estates, or of such Ranks and Orders: some give equal power to all that have Votes: some limit the inferior sort, and give more power to those of greater riches, The Corruption of this is called <hi>Ochlocratie,</hi> which is the confusion of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when the Rabble rout or multitude have the Rule, which they exercise to satisfie their giddy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or some private Interest against the Common-well-fare: Scarce any Democracy escapes this.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 79. A mixt Common-wealth is that, in which either two, or all three of these forms are so conjunct, that the Supremacy is divided among them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time equally, sometime unequally.</q>
               <p>It hath been a Controversie, to which of these forms our English Common-wealth was, and is to be reckoned: the uncertainty of this was one cause of our Wars: Many thought it was a pure Kingdom or Monarchy, where the whole Soveraignty is in the King. The Parliaments have affirmed it to be a mixt Common-wealth, yet denominated a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or Kingdom from some eminent Prerogatives of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170314:95"/> the King: The Reasons given by them I shall not stand on, save only this <hi>One.</hi> The Legislative Power is a part, if not the highest part of the Soveraignty; but much of the Legislative Power is, and hath been in the Parliaments hands: therefore much of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty is in their hands.</p>
               <p>But to put all out of Controversie, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Answer to the Nineteen Propositions of the Parliament, averres the same himself. As to them that argue from the Oath of Supremacy, and the Title given to the King, I refer them to Mr. <hi>Lawsons</hi> Answer to <hi>Hobbs</hi> Politicks, where he shews that the Title is oft given to the single person for the honour of the Common-wealth and his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, because he hath an eminent interest, but will not prove the whole Soveraignty to be in him: and the Oath excludeth all others from without, and not them whose interest is implyed as conjunct with his. The Laws and Customs of the Nation must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound such Names. The eminent Dignity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the King above others, allowed the name of a Monarchy or Kingdom to the Common-wealth though indeed the Soveraignty was mixt in the hands of Lords and Commons. If in the mixture the interest of the Prince had been least considerable, it should not have been called a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie or Kingdom, but an Aristocracy or Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy from the Party that had the most eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Majestas</hi> is in one Civil person called the <hi>Head</hi> of the Common-wealth: and the Common-wealth is individuated by the Head or Soveraign: and therefore if there were more Soveraigns or Heads then one, there would be more Common-wealths.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 81. That Democracy or Popular Government is ordinarily the worst, is proved by all these Arguments; 1. Because it comes nearest to the utter confounding of the Governors and Governed: the Ranks that God hath separated by his Institution.</q>
               <p>It is certain that God himself hath appointed that some be <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>some</hi> be <hi>Subjects:</hi> Now to make the Rulers and the Subjects the same, and so to make the people rule themselves, is next to the utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of the common-wealth, and nullifying Government. And therefore it is said four times over in the <hi>Judges.</hi> 17. 18, 19, and 21. That <hi>[In those days their was no King in Israel:]</hi> and twice its added; <hi>[But every man did that which was right in his own eyes,]</hi> as if there had been no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at all. And all because the temporary Monarch was interrupted, and the Aristocracy which continued began to grow weak, and savour too much of Democracy by the usurpation or tumults of the people</p>

               <p>Why else is every man excepted against, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Laws of God and Man, from being a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Judge in his own cause? And shall we have the greater part of the people be the highest Judges in their own cause?</p>

               <p>Multitudes in <hi>England,</hi> and more in <hi>Wales, Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, Ireland,</hi> the High-lands, are scarce able to talk reason about common things! And are these fit to have the Soveraign Power to Rule the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth? I have been very sensible of this at an Assize, when I have heard the Judge and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers industriously opening the case to the Jury, who stood by them as innocently as if they had heard nothing but Hebrew or Arabick all the while, and go their way, and bring in their Verdict, either as some one cunninger then the rest, perswades them, or else
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170314:96"/> at random or hap hazzard, speaking that which was next the tongues end, so that I thought it much at one, as to throw the dice upon it, who should have the day.

They that are the chief Governors of a Common-wealth, have need to be wholly or mostly vacant from all Aversions for so great a work: But common people must follow their Plows and Trades, and cannot be vacant for it: therefore they are unfit to Govern a Common-wealth.</q>
               <p>If any say that their bare Election of Governors
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170314:97"/> may serve turn, I shall shew you anon that that is not Governing, nor any part of it. The wisest men on earth will find that the Government of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will take up the whole man, and that they need no other Trade besides.

But the Major part are not onely likely but certain to be bad, yea Enemies to the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ends of Government, in most places of the world: therefore they are utterly unfit for Soveraignty.</q>
               <p>It is the badness of men that causeth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of all the forms of Government before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and subjecteth the publick good to private; and certainly (however some dream that their Laws and Engines can hamper any men) the Devil would never Govern well by any Laws. And Scripture and all experience tells us that the most are selfish, sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Worldlings haters of Godlinesse: An enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put from the beginning between the seed of the woman and of the Serpent, all this stir of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans is but to make the seed of the Serpent to be the Soveraign Rulers of the earth: when God hath promised that the Kingdoms of the world shall become Christs Kingdoms, these men would have them the Babels of Satan, the seat of confusion, and the enemies of Christ to raign through the earth. When Christ told his Apostles that he sent out them as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170314:97"/> Lambs among Wolves, these men would have these Wolves to be the Governors of the world: even those that Christ threatneth to slay: because they would not have him to raign over them, must be the men that must every where raign themselves, even those that he threatneth to bruise for their Rebellion with Rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces as a Potters vessell, <hi>Psalm. 2. Luke</hi> 19. 27. Were not this multitude restrained, they would presently have the blood of the godly. Late experience hath told us somewhat. Their hatred to piety is so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unreasonable, that I confess it confirms me in my belief of that Word of God, that doth affirm it of them. And if these men had once the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what a case were the World in.</p>
               <p>But Infidels that take evil for good, may flatter these persons, and make them believe that I unjustly reproach them, and may tell them, that they are all honest men, and it is but some self-conceited persons that censure them: But this will not cure their sin, nor prevent their misery, nor make them fit to govern us: Nor can they make us believe that Wolves are sheep in the open day light.</p>
               <p>Nor can they pretend that their Laws shall keep them from doing harm. For, 1 The Soveraign Power is the Law-giver, and therefore can change them at his pleasure: Our brutish impious rout may at any time make Laws for the banishing of piety and Christanity: and for the worshipping of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus;</hi> and if they but hoot, that <hi>[Great is Diana,]</hi> it is a Law. They have not the Soveraignty, if they cannot make and abrogate Laws. 2. And were they only inferior <hi>Governors,</hi> he is a <hi>fungus,</hi> and not a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170314:98"/> man that knoweth not by experience how easily bad men can make good Laws to be a nose of wax, and knock down their Adversaries with the very Manicles that we put upon their hands. It was a Proverb at <hi>Rome,</hi> that Vices had nailed the Laws to the Walls. Living Officers can easily a buse dead Laws. But of this more anon.</p>

Though no contrivance of man can ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Nation of a succession of good and righteous Governors, yet that is the best Government that giveth the strongest Probability of it; and that the worst, that maketh it impossible, or next to an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility: But that the Major Vote of the people shold ordinarily be just and good, is next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The former limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is sinfull in the Limiters, and yet may be submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to in some cases by the Soveraign innocently: the latter may be lawfull in both.</q>
                  <p>Inferior Magistrates may be limited according to the prudence of the Supreme; and more Power may be trusted to one, and less to another. But the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Ruler may not limited contrary to Gods Description or Institution of his Power; yet he may be limited <hi>de facto,</hi> though not <hi>de jure primario;</hi> and consequetly <hi>de jure</hi> as to hmselfe, that is, so

                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 103. God himself by enacting his own Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Laws, and instituting Magistracy for the Execution of them in subordination to him, doth thereby plainly tell us, that the Soveraign Powers in each Common-wealth are not to be restrained by the people from the Execution of any of his Laws, which belong to them as Magistrates to execute.</q>
                  <p>For Rulers are but Gods Officers for the subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Government of men by his Laws, and such subservient Laws of their own as are meet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the execution of his: For instance, If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall restrain the Soveraign Power form punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idolatry, or Adultery, or Theft, or false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they hereby sin against God, who hath appointed a Magistracy under him for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these sins in the world.</p>

If the peoples limitations would frustrate the end of Government, the Prince ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but rather to be no Governour: But if they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder the <hi>melius esse,</hi> or higher perfection of the Common-wealth, he may receive a sinfully limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power.</q>
                  <p>As if he be forbidden or disabled from encouraging Honesty and Piety in the main, or suppressing, or punishing wickedness in the main, or promoting the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170314:105"/> to accept of such a Power; For this is not that Office that God hath instituted, but another of mens devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and set up by his enemies. But if the limitation be only in some point that's integral, but not essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to Honesty, Piety, or Common good, (as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Theft, or Fornication only, or with such a degree of punishment) then he may assume it; but with a Protestation that it is not his own doing, nor doth he own the action of their restraint.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 105. The people can restraine a Prince <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> because they have the strength, and he cannot govern them without their own consent, either in whole, or in part: and therefore their dissent doth make the exercise of a further Power impossible to the Prince (or other Soveraign) and consequently justifie him.</q>
                  <p>If all the Army stand up for the life of a Traitor or Mutineer, the General is not able to punish him. If they refuse to go upon a particular design, the General cannot force them. If the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple resolve that they will have no Law (or not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere enough) against drunkenness or fornication, the Prince cannot help it. So if he Govern Papists, and they will not suffer him to restrain them, (or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like unlawfull Sect) it is their fault, and not his. He is not bound to an impossibility, nor bound to cast off all the Government and do no good, because he cannot do what he would: It is the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170314:105"/> people, and not he that gives liberty to the sin, (unless he consent to their fact, or his not resigning keep out one that could do more.) Their consent is <hi>Conditio sine qua non</hi> of his execution.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 106. Yet is this no act of Governing Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the people, nor doth it prove them to have the least measure thereof: but it is only an exercise of their natural Resolution upon the advantage of their strength, and in unlawfull cases; it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a mutinous disobedience against God, which is far from Authority.</q>
                  <p>And therefore the Dissent of one or two, or of so few that can be well mastered, no nor of the Major part when they can be mastered, is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to the supream Power from executing all the will of God committed to him as his Rule; nor will excuse him for his omissions, or his toleration of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. If my horse will go no further then his list, it followeth not that he is a sharer in the right of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himself and me, because he is unruly. Limiting by dissent is not Governing.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 107. Though the Prince may omit some good by reason of the peoples Dissent and Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet he may not commit any evill on any such pretence.</q>
                  <p>Duty is not at all times Duty. Affirmatives bind not <hi>ad semper:</hi> but sin is never to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170314:106"/> If the people will have a Toleration of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Sects, the Magistrate may yeild when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, or if it were to attain a greater good for the Church of God: because indeed it is but the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a Duty, (punishing Offenders) or making Laws against them) which at such a time and case is to him no duty. But if the people would force him to profess any false-opinion himself, or perform any false worship, he may not do it: Evil may not be done, when good may be omitted.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 108. Though God have not in his Universall Laws determined of the Degree of Princes Power in all Circumstantials or variable matters, yet he hath given general Laws for regulating of such deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations as there shall be cause.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>Material species</hi> (as some call it of Power is not fully, but yet thus far determined of by God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his Law. 1. He requireth that the supream Power be as his Authorized Officer, the Preserver of his own Universal Laws, and see them executed. 2. He restraineth him from doing any thing against those his Laws. 3. He giveth him general Rules, according to which all humane Laws must be made in undetdrmined cases. 4. He restraineth him from crossing these Rules in his Government.</p>

That he frame all his Laws and execution so as that they may be a means to the ends of Government! <hi>viz.</hi> both the neerest end, the Order, peace, and happiness, Corporall, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall of the Common-wealth; and the ultimate end, the Pleasing of God in our salvation for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</q>
                  <p>If any of the Laws of men be totally Cross to the fountaine and the end, or make against them in the maine, they are Nullities and private prohibited acts, of no authority: No forces, no advantages, no power, no engagement of men, can authorize any man against God, or against the salvation of our soules, and the Common safety of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this upon a twofold account: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are without <hi>Authority:</hi> 2. Because they are <hi>against the Chief Authority.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 111. Yet as Gods Laws are not all of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to the being of a loyal subject of his Kingdom, though all are obligatory, so the Magistrate that in point of Duty is bound to subserve and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all Gods Lawes, yet nullifieth not his office
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170314:107"/> or power by sinning against those that are not of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity as aforesaid.</q>
                  <p>Every thing that is a sin destroyeth not Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Christian, or Magistracy in a Magistrate: as some Laws and Duties, are but for the <hi>bene vel melius esse</hi> of our Christianity, and Magistracy: so some sins may tend effectually but to the diseasing of both.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 112. The people ought not to restraine the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power from a usefull Determination of things in themselves indifferent, according to the Generall Rules of God, for the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  <p>Under pretence of <hi>Liberty,</hi> they should not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Rulers from any Lawes or executions that are really for their own good (which is the main Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rule next Gods will and honour.)

                  <p>For it is but self-preservation, that nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man as man: but still it argueth not any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Governing power in them; but a strength exercised honestly for self-preservation, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be under such Laws or executions as would hazard, trouble or destroy them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 114. The People may have a true Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their estates, though they have no Right of Governing: and therefore here they may more Capitulate with the soveraign and restraine him from taking their Moneys, Goods, Lands, &amp;c. Without their consent, or but on contracted termes.</q>
                  <p>If the Laws of the land or Custome restraine the Prince from taking any mans money or goods without his consent, this is no proofe of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning authority in the people, for Propriety is not Government: Nor limiting a Ruler by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own, is not Ruling.</p>
                  <p>Dominion is in order of nature antecedent to Government, &amp; may be out of a Common-wealth as truly as in it. The distribution of Dominion or Propriety may be done by the ordinary Law of Nature conjunct with disposing Providence. Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation if it be agreeable to the Law of Nature [when men are under no other Law] that is, if it be not of another mans, nor of an undue proportion, &amp;c. may occasion a true Propriety. But if the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170314:108"/> would seize upon a whole Country or more then Nature alloweth as a proportion for one man, and tendeth to the Common hurt of the Community, or mankind, here he hath no Title and may be dispossest. But in Common-wealths: Propriety is partly made subject to the ends of the Common-wealth; and therefore Governing Lawes may give propriety, though there be a propriety in order of nature before any Lawes, but those of Nature.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 115. It is not safe or Lawfull for the people to limit or restrain the soveraign Power from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing so farre of the estates of all, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the safety of all, which is the end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>
                  <p>It is not the whole of mens Propriety that is to be subject to the Governour but part? and that Part is subject for the preservation of the whole remainder. Men have the primary Propriety in themselves, and the secondary in their estates: and as no Governor may take away the lives of all the people on pretence of justice or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but only some on just occasions, and that for the good of the rest, so no Governor may take away all the estates of the peoples, but only part to preserve the rest: Nor may he justly take from them the Propriety, leaving the possession. The King of <hi>Egypt</hi> could not take the peoples Lands and Cattle, as Governor, but as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracter, by Purchase, when <hi>Joseph</hi> sold them corn, and they parted with a great part of their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170314:108"/> propriety to save their lives. But to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety dependant, and limited as a Tenants, may be lawfull, if not by injustice nor unmercifulness accomplished.</p>
                  <p>If the Ruler have not Power to preserve the Common-wealth, he is not capable of the ends, and so not of the work of Government. It is for the peoples good that part be used to save the whole and themselves. But yet it is just and wisdom for the people in the constitution to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Ruler by convenient cautions that he may not under pretence of Preserving them have advantage to oppress them: and therefore it is unfit for the ordinary stated Revenews necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his personal or annual-publick use, should depend upon their after-Consent; (for so Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be brought into the case as those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that live on the peoples voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, and would find both murmuring and mutable Pay-masters) yet in extraordinary Taxes it is fit the people should restrain the Rulers from arbitrary seizures. And yet it is unfit that this restraint should be exercised by the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but rather by lome prudent chosen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as it is in our Parliaments. For the multitude are covetous, tenacious, injudicious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent judges of the necessities or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Common-wealth: and will make a small matter of their dangers, and publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and a great matter of their payments, till they are undone, and wise too late: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Contributions will occasion seditions, tumults, or unsettledness in the Common-wealth</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:170314:109"/>
                  <p>If the people, or any as chosen by them to that end, have only such a limiting self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power to themselves reserved, or a meer <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium discretionis</hi> about the necessities of the Common-wealth; this proveth not that they have any power in the Government, but if they have also a deliberating power about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dangers or diseases, and a directing or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Power about the Remedy (whether money arms, <hi>&amp;c)</hi> as a <hi>Remedy,</hi> then it is a part in the Government that is reserved to them.</p>

The propriety of particular men is subjected to the Governor as a Governor, so far as that he may judge in cases of difference, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Justice in giving every man his own, and may deprive men of part, or all that they possess by way of punishment for their crimes.</q>
                  <p>A Governor hath nothing to do in Government, if he had nothing at all to do with mens proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for as he decideth differences about it as Judge, and maketh Laws which shall be the Rule of such decisions, so he may take away all that a man hath as a penalty, and make Laws which shal be the Rule of that Penaltie. What do penal Laws but deprive men (for the most part) of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, when they forfeit it by their crimes? The Magistrate may take away mens lives for their crimes; therefore he may take away their money or Lands: for their lives are as much their own, and are more precious to them. And if he may not punish Offenders, he is no Governor.</p>

                  <p>For if under pretence of Justice every mans Life and Estate should be meerly at the mercy of of an Arbitrary unlimited Prince, it were as bad as to have all left to his will, when he will pretend a necessity for the publick safety or commodity directly. They may see in the constitution that vertues be not punished as vices, nor the innocent (by a Law) as if they were guilty: and that none but well chosen able men be Judges, and that they be responsible to the Supream: and that the penalties exceed not the crimes, nor the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact judged without sufficient witness; and such like restrictions they may put to escape In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; but such disable not the Governor to do Justice ordinarily.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 118. If the Soveraign be not limited in the constitution, or by his own consent, but only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms entrusted with the Soveraignty, he may by vertue of his Soveraignty dispose of the Estates of the Subjects in order to the ends of Government: But though there be no <hi>express restraint</hi> upon him in the constitution, yet can he do nothing against the Laws of God, or the ends of Government.</q>
                  <p>It is implyed in the constitution of every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it cannot be used against its supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170314:110"/> Power, or its end. This God hath obliged them to already, and therefore it is firm, though men say nothing. And therefore a Governor as he is a subordinate Officer of God, is restrained from Injustice, and so from seising on the Estates of others, for himself or his Favorites, or without the demand of Justice, or the publick good. But in these cases his office alloweth, yea, and bindeth him to do it, if not restrained notoriously by the constitution. And he would be an enemy to the Common-wealth, if he suffer it to perish in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of mens private good.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 119. It seems to many a very difficult Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Whether a Soveraign should save the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth when the limitations in the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion disable him? But the Answer is easie. If the danger be not certain or very great, he is to keep his bounds and Covenant: and if mischief fall on the common-wealth, the people by their foolish li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations were guilty, and its they that must bear the main loss. But if the danger be great, and the people express not their dissent, the Soveraign may trangress his limits to save the Common-wealth, because the constitution being for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon safety, it is to be supposed that the Authors of it did intend the end, before they chose the means, and therefore did mean, that if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations should fall out to be inconsistent with the end, they should be nul.</q>
                  <p>Nature alloweth us to suppose that no man would destroy himself, till we are able to prove
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170314:110"/> the contrary. And when we can prove it, we thereby prove him a mad-man, or of so depraved an Intellect, as that he is not fit to be covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with: much less then, may we suppose that a Nation or Society of men intend their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: Nor that they intended rather to perish, then their limitations should be observed. But if a Soveraign break his bounds without such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as is either notorious before hand, or he can afterward make notorious to the people for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <hi>Thes.</hi> 120. But it seems a harder Question what the Soveraign should do in case the people not only limit him by Covenants, but actually desire the way that destroy them, and dissent from his preserving them, whither may he save the common-wealth against the peoples wills? The Answer is easie, that he may do it, both as he is a Governor, and so an Officer of God for the ends of Government, and therefore cannot lawfully be restrained by the people from preserving them, because they have no Power above God: and also as a private man <hi>ex charitate,</hi> he is bound to save a Nation if he can, though without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; as we must save a man from drowning or hanging himself, or quench the fire which he kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in his own thatch. And because it is still to be supposed that the people desire their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and therefore mistakingly resist the means, which else they would consent to.</q>

                  <p>This cause may fall out, though to some it ma seem impossible, especially in times of War; and especially in the Army it self, when the souldiers by their ignorance and remerity may presently cast themselves away, if they be not hindred. And the people by the power of deceits, or fear, may subjugate themselves to barbarous destroyers. But yet it is no ordinary case as to the temporal good of the people: and when it doth fall out, it rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls out, that the Soveraign is able to deliver them. It ofter falls out, about the peoples spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal good, and Gods honour: and how far the Governor may here preserve them (by a minor part, or by forreign strength) against the wills of the Major part, I shall shew anon.</p>

                  <hi>THes.</hi> 121. There is no Governing Power but what is from God the Absolute Universal Lord and Soveraign.</q>
               <p n="1">1. All Beings besides the first, must have a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and beginning: and therefore so must Power. But it can have no Beginning but from God; nor can any other be the fountain, or first cause, therefore it is from God. Man is not the first cause of his own being: therefore not of his Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover we have no natural Power, called <hi>Strength,</hi> but from God; therefore we can have no Civil Power, called <hi>Authority,</hi> or Right of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but from God: Eor we can no more have one without him, then the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ascribe Power to any other as the first efficient cause, then God, is to make more Gods then one; for that which hath a independent underived Power, and is the first cause, is God. And if this be ascribed to any creature, it is an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous deifying of that Creature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It belongeth to the absolute Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign to be the fountain of all inferiour Power: But God is the absolute Universal Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, therefore, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>

                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:170314:112"/>5. The Holy Scripture seconds the Light and Law of nature in this and tells us, that <hi>[There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordained of God: whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 2.

               <p>It is therefore Treason against the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for any man or Angel to pretend to a Power that is not derived from him, who is the Cause of Causes, and Original of Power.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 122. Every earthly Soveraign therefore is an Officer of God, receiving his power from him as his highest Soveraign, and being obliged to use it for him, being himself but a subordinate Soveraign of a part of the Universal Kingdom.</q>
               <p>In the fore-cited Text, the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors (as its commonly judged by Commentators) are called <hi>[The Ministers of God.]</hi> All higher Powers are so called, I am sure▪ And he that is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. They that deny the prince to be Gods Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, rob him of that Beam of divine Excellency, which is the highest part of all his Dignity, from whence Princes have been called Metaphorically
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170314:112"/> Gods. The least beam of Majesty derived from God, hath greater splendor then all the world as from it self is able to communicate. To make a Free-man a slave, is not so great an abatement, as to make a Prince that is an Officer of God, to be meerly a terrestrial <hi>Animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They that deny Princes to be Gods Officers, do tempt them to be Traitors, both in denying the derivation of their Power from their Soveraign, and in denying to use it to his service and honour. The end must be no higher then the beginning: If God be not the efficient, he need not be made the end of Magistrates Power: By which you may see, that there cannot be a more unreasonable, impious, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Opinion divulged among the sons of men, then that Magistrates have not their Power from God, as his Officers: for it is to deny God to be God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, if this Opinion were true, then peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple need not obey their Magistrates as Gods Officers, and so would abate the cheif part of their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them, and their Obedience would be but meerly humane, and not participatively divine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And thence it would follow, that no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due from God to the Disobeyers of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates: For if God appoint them not, he will not punish us for not obeying them: for his Sanction is affixed to his own Laws. But we are commanded to obey them, not onely for wrath, but for conscience sake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 123. The fifth Commandment is therefore placed as between the first and second Table, as being partly a Command of our Duty to God in his Officers, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170314:113"/> partly the first Command of our Duty to men, even to the men that are most highly dignified by the Communication of that beam of Authority from God.</q>
               <p>We commonly place the fifth Commandment in the second Table: but some of the antient Doctors of the Church did place it in the first, as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Duty to Rulers, not as men, but as the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of God: and so each Table had five Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Me thinks it is according to the infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, placed so between both, as that it should be left dubious to us, which of them it belongs to, as participating of both in its nature. And some think, that part of it was written on the first Table of stone, and part on the second. But certainly Power is a Ray from God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 124. Our principal search then must be to find out the line of Derivation, how, and by what means this Power is conveyed from God. And to that end, we must enquire what he hath done himself as part of his Universal standing Law, and what he hath left to be done, with variations according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of times, and places, and persons.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 125. And first, It is most certain that God hath himself determined in the Law of nature, &amp; of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there shall be Governors and subjects, Rule and Obedience in the world; and hath not left the world to liberty, whether they will have Governors or not</q>
               <p>This is proved before. If all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e world agreed to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170314:113"/> depose their Rulers, or live without, it would not become lawful by the agreement, but an act of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience against God. This therefore is not left to mans decision, but they are prevented by Gods Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes</hi> 126. Secondly, God hath been pleased in his Universal Laws of nature and Scripture to determine of the ends of Government; that his Pleasure, and Honor, and the common-good, and order as necessary thereto, shall be the end: this therefore is not left to the decision of man.</q>
               <p>So that if all men should agree that Magistrates shall not respect the honor or pleasing of God, or the common good, it were but treachery and folly, and an agreement of no validity at all. The end being essentiall to the Relation here, it followeth, that whoever is a Magistrate, must use his power to these ends, though all men should gain say it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 127. Thirdly, God hath himself made certain Universal stated Laws, which all Princes and States must promote and execute as his Officers; and no man on earth have Power to null them, or dispense with them: It is not therefore left to mans decision whether they will observe these Laws of God, or not.</q>
               <p>All the Laws of men are in two respects different from these of God. First, Gods Laws are Universal for all the world; but mans are patticular, or limited for their several Common-wealths. As the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Powers make Universal Laws for the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> but may give a <hi>Corporation</hi> power to make by Laws for that Corporation about inferior things.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:170314:114"/>
               <p>And secondly, Gods Laws are superior fixed Laws, above the highest Prince on earth, which bind them as Subjects to God, &amp; they cannot dispense with; &amp; therefore they are limited by them in their own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislations and Jurisdiction, yea all that they do must subserve them, whereas Princes, or others that have Soveraign Power are above their own Laws as such. He that is bound by a Law, is so far subject: He that is a Subject, is a Subject to some Superior: Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns have no earthly Superiors; but they are as much subject to God as others. As no Justice of Peace hath any power against the Laws of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, so neither have Kings against the Laws of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 128. God hath described in his word (and much in the Law of nature) the Rulers, that shall receive Authority from him as his Officers: so that it is not left to the liberty of any people whom they will choose: but this description containeth some qualifications ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the being of an Officer of God, and some that are necessary but to the well-being: therefore if the latter be violated by the Choosers, it is a sin, but not a Nullity: if the former be violated, it is a Nullity as well as a sin.</q>
               <p>The King or State may give Power to a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to choose their Major or Bayliffe, but the Charter expresly or implicitely limiteth them what men to chuse. If they chuse a Drunkard or a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is not a Nullity, though a fault: but if they chose an open out-lawd Rebel, it is a Nullity: or if their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor after he is chosen, renounce the Soveraign Power, he nullifieth his own Authority. What are a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170314:114"/> Rulers necessary qualifications, I shall touch anon.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 129. All these things being determined already by God himself, it is certain that neither Peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, nor conquest can be the fountaine or proper cause of any of these: but it must be somewhat low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that they have to do.</q>
               <p>That which is done already by the great Law-giver of the world, cannot be left to the will of men, nor become their works: but its their work to obey the Lord.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 130. That which God hath left undetermined in his Universal Laws, is 1. Whether it shall be one, or two, fewer or more that shall have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power under him in particular Common-wealths. 2. And who shall be the individual persons. And 3. Much of the matter of their Laws, which is to be varied agreeably to times and persons.</q>
               <p>Though Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy are commonly called the distinct <hi>species</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths and Governments, yet it is indeed no more then to determine who shall be the persons Governing: The Election of individuals doth it as to the individual persons, and the constitution doth it <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> as to Successors, determining also of the number. So that the substance of the Office is all predetermined of by God in his own Laws; and this <hi>specificat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  </hi> and choice of individuals do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the persons. The Reason why God hath not himself in his standing Universal Laws determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of either of these, is, because they were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170314:115"/> such a dettermination: For the Individuals were not existent, when God made his Laws: the names of <hi>Caesar, Alexander, Alphonsus,</hi> &amp;c. were not to be inserted into those Laws, they being unborn when the Law of nature was made, and are of short con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and must presently resign their Crown to their Successors: &amp; if all that ever should Govern in the world had been forenamed by God in his Laws, it would have brought as great inconveniences on the world, as if every man before hand should be told how long he shall live and whether he shall be rich or poor. God is not to be taught by man how to govern the world.</p>

                  <hi>The.</hi> 131. The essentiall Qualifications of a Governour, or that <hi>Dispositio materiae</hi> that is of necessity <hi>ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionem &amp; retentionem formae, (and</hi> not only <hi>ad melius esse)</hi> are those without which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not capable of performing the essential workes of Governmont</q>
               <p>Government in the exercise hath somewhat essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, or of absolute necessity, and somewhat that is but for the <hi>melius esse,</hi> and therefore Governing Power hath so too; and what the latter is must be known, by knowing what the former (the necessary exercise is) for the Power is for the use &amp; exercise.</p>

In a <hi>proper Common-wealth</hi> that is subject to God the Universal soveraign, it is essentially necessary that the Government be so exercised, 1, As that the Being of the Common-wealth may be preserved, 2. And so much of

They that are in a worse condition, or as bad as if they had no Government, indeed, have none: only here note, to avoid mistakes, 1. That this is spoken of the <hi>body of the people,</hi> and not of a <hi>few particular persons:</hi> for if unjustly they be so used as to be worse then without Government, yet that dissolveth not the Common-wealth. 2.

Without the foresaid degree of Reason and Wisdom, there is not <hi>materia disposita &amp; capax,</hi> because the persons are uncapable of the worke, and so of the end, and so of the Power: And therefore Ideots, Fools and Infants cannot be the actual Soveraigns, that is, <hi>in statu &amp; relatione,</hi> be the present Governors. Indeed they may have the name of Soveraignty, while others have the Ezercise and Power of that Exercise, and they may be in a distant capacity, or the way to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and may have some foundations laid by the constitution, that the actual Government shall be by them, when they are actually capable: which some call a <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> but is but an Hypothetical Right to a future actual Right: if they live to the use of Reason, and to be of capacity; they shall have actual Right to Govern: or if you will call

We speak of the total Soveraignty. If in a mixt Common-wealth a Prince be an Infant, the Senate or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath the other part of the Soveraignty, may have the exercise of the whole during his Infancy: But if Senate, and all be Infants, they are no actual Governors: When a Counsell, or other Administrators appointed by the constitution, do exercise the whole Soveraign Power or part, they have Power so to exercise it: And if they have Power and Exercise. they are really <hi>pro tempore</hi> the Soveraign, though the right of <hi>present, nominal, and future real Soveraignty</hi> may be in an Infant Prince.</p>

               <p>For a Governor so <hi>impotent,</hi> is none. A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for the work and end is necessary in the person: and when that ceaseth, the <hi>Power</hi> Iceaseth. Not by such a Cessation alwayes as eaveth the people innocent; for its possible, and likely that the guilt is, or may be theirs, who have disabled their Ruler by deserting him: But, 1. If they do it sinfully, yet he is dissmissed and disobliged from the charge of Government. 2. And particular innocent Members are disobliged from being Governed by him, though through the sin of others. But it is not every actual temporary dispossession that disobligeth statedly, as I shall shew more anon.</p>

If an Army (of Neighbours, or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or whoever) do (though injuriously) expel the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and resolve to ruine the Common-wealth, rather then he shall be restored, and if the Common-wealth may prosper without his restauration, it is the duty of such an injured Prince, for the common good to resign his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he will not, the people ought to judge him as made uncapable by providence, and not to seek his resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to the apparent ruine of the Common-wealth.</q>
               <p>The reason is, because it is essential to Government to be for the common good; and he is for the people finally, rather then they for him: And Government ceaseth to be just Government, when it ceaseth to be a means to its end: much more when it is destructive to it. The <hi>jus regendi</hi> is not like meer <hi>Dominion</hi> (I mean <hi>Propriety,)</hi> which is but a power or <hi>right</hi> to <hi>use and dispose</hi> of things as <hi>our own,</hi> and <hi>for our selves.</hi> But it is like the office of a <hi>Physitian, School-master, Pilot,</hi> &amp;c. who are <hi>principally</hi> for the <hi>good of others,</hi> and but <hi>secondarily for their own reward and honour.</hi> And therefore no man on earth can pretend <hi>propriety</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> against the <hi>common good,</hi> and ends of that Government. For that is to <hi>change the nature</hi> of the thing, and then plead an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it, as Government, when they have made it no (just) Government at all.</p>

It is not lawful for a people to chuse, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have no Governour, then not to have him that is their rightful Prince: for that <hi>there shall be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and subjection,</hi> is the stated Law of God, to which the <hi>right choise of persons</hi> is but subordinate: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rightful Governour be so long dispossest that the Common-wealth can no longer be without Government, but to the apparent hazard of its ruine, we ought to judge that providence hath dispossest the former, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to consent to another.</q>
               <p n="1">1. The right of persons is in subserviency to the Government it self and the ends of it: and therefore if any man will set the means against the end, or a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of humane determination against a Law of God, and say, Because we cannot have such a man, we will have none, but be ungoverned; this is to break an express commandment, and to cast off the order and ordinance of God, for a persons sake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If people have no Government, vice will reign, and every mans estate and life will be at the mercy of his enemy, or him that hath a mind to it, and is the stronger: And therefore no people can long subsist without Government.</p>

               <p>A people without a particular Soveraign, are still parts of Gods universal Kingdom, and from him they are to receive their officers, if he appoint them; for still they are under the obligation of his Laws. Though the peoples consent (explicite or implicite) be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Soveraigns actual Government, and consequently to his right of governing them, by which he must himself be warranted and justified; yet are the people usually under a previous obligation from the Lord, whom they shall consent to, and whom not. And <hi>Conquest</hi> is the most usual means of the determination: not by giving <hi>Right</hi> to govern, but by making the Conquerour <hi>materiam dispositam,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:170314:125"/> the only capable subject of that right, and object of the peoples choice. The same may be said of any other possession of such power as the Conquerour hath. Ordinarily did the Roman Emperours (formerly at <hi>Rome,</hi> and since at <hi>Constantinople)</hi> die or suffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, by an Usurper; and yet the subjects obeyed the Usurper, and the Christian Bishops took it to be their duty so to do. If his Conquest or Occupation be sinful, yet if he thereby become the only capable person to Govern, the people are to consent (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing no special impediment to forbid it.) If they be (though through anothers sin.) disobliged from their former Governour, (by his death, incapacity, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> they are bound by God to consent to such as are most capable.</p>

               <p>Because being supposed uncapable of Governing them, their Government would be as hurtful as to be without a Government. And if Gods honour and soveraignty must be traiterously despised, and the common good destroyed, it is better that it be done without the peoples consent, then with it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 153. Any thing that is a sufficient sign of the will of God, that <hi>this</hi> is the person, by whom we must be Governed, is enough (as joyned to Gods Laws) to oblige us to consent, and obey him as our Governour.</q>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170314:125"/>
               <p>God being the chooser of his own Officers, and the universal King, who bindeth us to obey his choice, doth make known his will to man by <hi>signs:</hi> For we cannot immediately see his essence, and therefore not his will. All his Laws that oblige us, are but so many <hi>signs</hi> of his will: and he may choose his sign.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 154. It being already signified in the Law of God, that a people that are without a Ruler shall consent to such as are fittest for them, and the qualifications of such being there exprest, the rest of Gods will to be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the people, to bring them under the particular obligation, is but for the discovery of the persons thus qualified: so that Law and providence concurring, are Gods nomination of his Officers, whom the people by him are bound first to consent to be subject to, and then to obey.</q>
               <p>Here are several acts of Gods Law, and several acts of <hi>Providence,</hi> necessary in concurrence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Soveraign. 1. There is presupposed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Law, for Government and obedience, distribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the subjects of Gods Kingdom, into particular subordinate Soveraigns, and their Subjects. 2. There is supposed Gods Laws, that cut them out their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal work, and describe the substance of the office, and limit them. 3. The Law of God describeth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in the points necessary to the <hi>Being,</hi> and the well being of their Government. 4. The same Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth the people to consent to such, (in case they are called to such a work, as choosing or consenting.) Thus far the <hi>Law</hi> goeth.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>Providence,</hi> 1. Doth qualifie the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170314:126"/> 1. With tolerable wisdom. 2. And Goodness (so far as to be a capable Instrument for the Ends of Government.) 3. And with Power to defend the people and execute Laws. And many acts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may concur to this: especially it is by giving a man such Interest in the Affections of the stronger part, that by them he may be put into a capacity. 2. And when he is qualified, to bring him upon the stage to the peoples observation, that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Qualifications, is an Act of Providence for the discovery of Gods Will; and so to bring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under an Obligation to consent. 3. And when they are so obliged, the bringing of their hearts to consent and accept him, is another Act of Providence antecedent to his Possession, and ordinarily to such a Title as will justifie his Government.</p>
               <p>So that the peoples Obligation is thus inferred and induced by God.</p>
               <p>Whomsoever I thus and thus Qualifie, and declare to be the fittest person, you shall consent to.</p>
               <p>But this man (or these men) I have so qualified and declared: therefore to them you shall consent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is in Gods Law (of Nature and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, most express.) The <hi>Minor</hi> is the voice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (taking the word for Actual disposal of Events) and both together infer the <hi>conclusion,</hi> and induce the <hi>Obligation,</hi> but with the difference follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

Hence it is plain that this Disposal of Providence, is not instead of a Law, or speaketh not <hi>de debito,</hi> but <hi>de facto,</hi> and therefore doth not it self ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently oblige: but it only designeth the person and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170314:126"/> him, to whom we shall by the Law be obliged to consent.</q>
               <p>For Providence saith but <hi>[This is the qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son]</hi> which words have not the nature of a Law, nor do themselves oblige; but of a <hi>Nomination:</hi> so that it is the universal Law that doth oblige, though not without the <hi>Nomination of Providence.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 156. When the Nomination is referred to a Lot, that Lot determineth but in this way of Providence, nominating the person, leaving the Obligation still to the Law.</q>
               <p>What a <hi>Lot</hi> may do, <hi>another Providence</hi> may do; but the lot may determine of the persons: therefore so may other Providence. God hath many wayes of signifying his mind to us, and nominating the persons, and hath not tyed himself to any one; nor must we limit him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 157. Where God dooh not notably declare any person qualified above others, nor one, two, or any certain Number to be most fit for the Soveraignty of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so that the case is not <hi>Notorious,</hi> but <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> there the people must judge as well as they are able, according to Gods General Rules, or else refer it to a Lot.</q>
               <p>This is counted the freest Choyce, when people are not plainly pre-obliged: but indeed there is no more desirable freedom, but oft-times less, in this Case then the other. If God do for our good so plainly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170314:127"/> qualifie and declare our Governours as to leave it out of doubt to us, and so to pre-oblige us, it is a mercy, and not a depriving us of any desirable liberty: And if there be none of such Eminency, but that we are left to a choyce out of many equals, it doth but make us the more work.</p>

All people have not right to such free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; sometime whole Nations, but commonly a part of every Nation, should be denyed the liberty of choosing their Governours, and be compelled to consent: and to make all Choosers is injurious and destructive to the Common wealth.</q>
               <p>The first branch (which denyeth freedom of choice to some whole Nations) is all that is lyable to controversie, which yet is so plain, that it needs not many words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes divers Nations may constitute <hi>One</hi> Common-wealth. And then there is as much reason why a whole Nation, as a mixed part, should be thought Capable of forfeiting their liberties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes divers Nations may be under the same Princes Government. And then if he can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Crown as to them, by any Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170314:127"/> on his part, no doubt but part of them may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Liberty, by Treason and Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on theirs, and he may Rule them by the power of his other Kingdoms; As the Romans did many of the Nations that they Conquered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometime the Neighbourhood of unjust, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies, is not to be tolerated, without the ruine of the Righteous Nations round about them, unless they be kept under by meer force; and so self-preservation may warrant it. Men that choose to live as enemies in war with us, must be used upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary terms. Till they shew themselves worthy of Trust, they are not to be used as free Subjects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes men may forfeit their Liberties to God and men so notoriously, that the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations warranteth Neighbour Princes to subdue them, and govern them by force. As 1. In Case they should turn Atheists, and defie the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal King, and seek to poyson the Neighbour Nations with this Treason against God. 2. In Case they live as Canibals, that eat mans flesh, and are as wild beasts, that hunt for men to devour them, whether it be their fellow-natives, or the Neighbour Nations. 3. In Case they professedly design the Conquest of all others about them, and will live upon no other terms in peace, but as Conquerers or Conquered. 4. Specially in Case they claim a right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms about them, and specially a Divine Right; that all Princes should obey them, and make it their unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Religion, as the Pope doth. He that thus claims a Right to dispose of Crowns and Kingdoms, though but <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> proclaimeth war with all the World; and warranteth any Prince that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170314:128"/> is within his danger to make war against him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Law of Nature may bind a Christian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Charity to Rule some Nations by force. If a poor barbarous Indian-Nation, like the Canibals, would not consent to hear the Gospel, or suffer Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to come among them, and speak to a <hi>minor</hi> part that would hear, I am sure it hath an apparent tendency to their salvation to master them, and force them to admit the Preachers, and to restrain them from murdering the Christians among them that had received the Gospel: And as long as we did them no hurt, but govern them, and did not deprive them of their Possessions, I know not what should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt us from the Obligation to this as a work of Charity. Doubtless a meer Neighbour, by the Law of Charity, is bound to hold a mans hands that would kill himself, or pull him out of the water that would drown himself, and to quench his house though against his will, which he sets on fire, and to save his Children, or Neighbours persons or houses from his fury, in case of the like attempts: And why then a work of ten thousand times greater benefit, should not on the same grounds be done, I know not. If the Prince and major part of the people, in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour petty Common-wealth would put to death the minor part, because they are Christians, and a Potent neighbour Prince were easily able to restrain them, I doubt not but he would be guilty of the murder and extirpation of Christianity, if he do not: And if he cannot continue their preservation, without a continued restraint, or subduing the malignant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Laws of Neighbourhood, and Charity, and the Common good of mankind, and the Ends of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170314:128"/> Universal Government require him to do it.</p>
               <p>If any say that upon such pretences Atheists and Heathens that are the stronger part, may invade a weaker Christian State to force them to deny God, or Christ, or acknowledge Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I answer, 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found not the <hi>Jus</hi> and the <hi>factum:</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> and the <hi>legal</hi> Power. They <hi>may</hi> do it <hi>de facto per potentiam Naturalem,</hi> which is nothing to the case, but they <hi>may not</hi> do so <hi>de jure per potentiam Legalem,</hi> because God hath given them no such Power.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you will give them occasion to pretend Authority; and if they are the stronger party, they will be the Judges. Answ.</hi> No duty can be done, from whence the wicked cannot fetch pretences for their sin. If a <hi>righteous</hi> Judge shall hang Murderers or Thieves, he is not therefore to be blamed, because an <hi>unrighteous</hi> Judge may take occasion by it to hang the innocent as guilty of their crimes. If our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may destroy the plundering Enemies, and rescue the oppressed Countrey men, and the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may thence fetch a pretence to destroy ours as guilty of that crime, though they be innocent, we must not therefore neglect the defence of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Malignant enemies will not be reduced to reason, if we should neglect our duty for it; but the wicked will do wickedly: some inconveniences will still attend the imperfections of humane Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the final Judgement will set all strait. Let us do our Duty, and stay till God do Justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that by Power are out of the reach of Justice, from the hand of man.</p>
               <p>But that which nearlier concerneth us (and as near as any thing in our frame of Government) is the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170314:129"/> latter part of the Thesis; that all the people in the same Common-wealth should not have the freedom of choosing Governours, which I shall therefore more distinctly handle.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 160. It is commonly granted that nature and want of competent wealth may deprive the most innocent of a capacity of this freedom. Much more will a mans wilful crimes deprive him of it.</q>
               <p>I grant that all these may be Subjects: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by course of Justice they are deprived of them, let them enjoy their Possessions as much as any other Subjects, allowing for the securing of them, the same Tributes and Taxes as all others. But it is a <hi>Burgeship,</hi> or freedom of <hi>Governing,</hi> or <hi>choosing any Governours, Parliament-men, Justices,</hi> &amp;c. that we speak of.</p>
               <p>Nature maketh <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>Ideots</hi> uncapable: and <hi>women</hi> choose not members of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Servants</hi> are commonly judged uncapable, and so are the <hi>poor:</hi> not only because they have not those faculties necessary to support the Government, but principally because <hi>necessity</hi> maketh them <hi>dependant</hi> upon others; and therefore it is supposed that they are <hi>not free</hi> in their <hi>Elections.</hi> How far the reason reacheth to Tenants, the Law-givers, though they are Land-Lords, seem not to be insensible, when all that have not Leases for life are excluded from the number of free-holders.</p>
               <p>But that multitudes of <hi>wicked criminous</hi> persons, how rich soever, should much rather be excluded then honest beggars, and that <hi>this, this, this,</hi> is the great point that the welfare of most Common-wealths
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170314:129"/> doth depend upon, I shall now make manifest.</p>
               <p>Argum. 1. <hi>If many Vices make persons less fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern or choose Gnvernours, then poverty doth, conjoyned with honesty, then should such vicious persons, rather be excluded from both: But the Antecedent is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Argum. 2. <hi>If men should lose their lives or estates by way of Punishment for some crime, then should they lose their liberty of Governing and choosing Governours by way of punishment for those or other crimes to which such punishment is proportionable</hi> (for there is a parity of Reason.) <hi>But the Antecedent is practically confest:</hi> Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Argum. 3. <hi>If confessedly crimes should deprive men of a capacity to Govern, so also they must do of a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of choosing Governours:</hi> (for there is a parity of Reason in ordinary cases, though not in all) <hi>But the Antecedent is granted by our Parliaments,</hi> who sentence some as disabled to be members any more: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Argum. 4. <hi>That course which equalleth the worst with the best in the Priviledges of freemen, is not just: But so doth the equal admitting the innocent and the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous to govern and choose Governours:</hi> Ergo &amp;c. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is better then wealth, &amp; Vice worse then Poverty.</p>
               <p>Argum. 5. <hi>That course that tendeth to the dishonour of Princes, Parliaments, or other Magistrates under them that are Elective, is not to be maintained. But such is the liberty of the criminous to Elect them:</hi> For nothing more natural then for freemen to choose such as are agreeable to their wills and wayes: and if they be not free, they should not choose. It will therefore raise suspitions on our Parliaments and Magistrates, that they are friends at least to wicked men and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170314:130"/> wayes, when they are ordinarily and freely chosen by such men: especially if it be by their own Laws and desires, that such shall be the Choosers.</p>
               <p>Argum. 6. <hi>Those that are known enemies to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good in the cheifest parts of it, are unmeet to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern or choose Governours:</hi> (else give us up to our enemies, or to Satan:) <hi>But such are multitudes of ungodly vicious men.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>He that thinketh that wealth is the only common good, or a greater part of it then Vertue, Piety, and mens salvation; and that Rulers have nothing to do with the latter, but with mens Bodily prosperity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is fitter to be a member of a <hi>Herd</hi> then a <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> and to be dimitted with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> into a company suitable to his judgement: yea and to be used as a Traytor of the highest and most odious strain, that destroyeth and brutifieth the very office of every Prince and Magistrate, and casteth them into the dirt.</p>
               <p>And that ungodly vicious men are Enemies to the greatest part of the common good directly, and to the rest indirectly, is known to every wise and sober honest man. 1. They hate <hi>Godliness,</hi> which is the truest <hi>Honesty;</hi> and Holiness, without which none shall see God: and therefore if they can, will choose such as hate it. 2. They hate <hi>good Laws,</hi> which would encourage the Piety and Vertue which they hate, and punish the Vices which they love. 3. They hate <hi>Good Magistrates,</hi> and therefore are unlike, if they be free, to choose them. 4. And they are all men of Private spirits, and value their private Interests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Publike Good, and would sell the chief feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Common-wealth for a little money, if
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170314:130"/> they can scape themselves. 5. They are ready to betray the Common-wealth to a forraign enemy, in meer malignity, to have their wills: As the <hi>Papists</hi> that joyned with <hi>Stanley in</hi> 88. and the <hi>Powder-plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after,</hi> and so in many Countries else. Are the Irish fit to govern or choose Governours? If not, and if experience forceth us to exclude the man body of the Natives there, we have reason to exclude such here as forfeit their Liberties. We do them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrong nor hurt, but preserve our selves from ruine, and them from greater guilt. To govern us, does them no good.</p>
               <p>Arg. 7. <hi>Such as God commanded to be put to death, or cut off from the Common-wealth of Israel, should not be Governours or Choosers of such, in any Christian Common-wealth</hi> (supposing an equality in guilt.) <hi>But such are many vicious ungodly persons among us.

But I speak of such as for the like facts are now as culpable as they. And in general I may lay this ground, that the more abundant light of the Gospel, and the greater helps and grace, and the greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness now required, do all shew that the same sins <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> are much more haynous now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A people that detest and are innocent of the Treason, perfidiousness, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, &amp;c. of an usurper, may after become obliged to obey him, and take him for the Governour whom the people of the Common-wealth are bound to obey.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 174. If the Progenitors Consent to an established form of Government; and the way of succession, whether Hereditary, or by Elections of each Governour, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent obligeth their Progeny, so long, till either a mutual Consent of Governours and people again disoblige them, or the Rulers disoblige them by destroying the Form or End of the Government, or God by Providence dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them.</q>
               <p>If Posterity were not obliged by their Progenitors Acts, all Common-wealths would be short-lived. And frequent mutations would keep up continual distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and confusions. And though the Maxime of some is, that Parents can oblige their Posterity, when the Covenant is for their good only, and not to their loss and hurt; yet these considerations must be here admitted for the due application of it. 1. In a mutual Covenant or Contract, it is supposed that the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of both Parties is taken in. And as the people receive more from the Soveraign then he from them, and therefore are more beholden to him; so his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract supposeth something on his own side to be thereby secured, as well as on theirs. 2. And it is not every tolerable incommodity that disobligeth Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Covenants of their Ancestors; but such as makes them worse then to be without the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and that over weigheth the Benefits that by his Government they receive. No wise man would be the Ruler of such a people that are able and willing to cast him off, whenever they conceive they incurr any incommodity by his Government.</p>

               <p>Deny this, and you overthrow all humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. For if men may go from their Covenants on this pretence, then on many the like, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will be common. Man is a free Agent, and his Will cannot properly be compelled: If you threaten him with death, he may suffer it: It is supposed therefore that whatever he promiseth, he freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth. We use to say, a man is forced, when fear moveth him to consent: But this is not a proper force: It taketh not away the Liberty of the Will. He that consenteth, doth it to avoid some greater evil, which he thinks would else have befaln him; and it is his own Good that moveth him to it; <hi>[He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not]</hi> is the person that is accepted of God, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 15. 4.

I add, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the case be such (which is possible) that to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick use the money is of more worth then my life; and then as it was unlawful to promise, so is it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: But what you may lawfully promise, you may

If the concealing of the Thief will do more hurt to the Common wealth, and wrong to God, then the yeilding up of my life, I may not promise it: and if I promise it, I may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, because it is evil, and not in my power; But if it be otherwise, I may promise or perform it.

               <p>Thus war useth to prepare for change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if all such contracts should be null, most Common-wealths on earth were null, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects disobliged, and warranted to rebel.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 177. The true Fundamental Laws of every Common-wealth, are the Laws of God the Ʋniversal King.</q>
               <p>For, 1. These are they that lay the foundation of Government, as is before more fully opened. 2. These are they that Princes are bound by, and none can change. 3. These are they that limit all the Laws of men, and nullifie such as contradict them. Properly therefore these are the true (if not only) Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal laws of Common-wealths.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 178. The Constitution of Common-wealths by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170314:134"/> man, as to that modal difference of Governments, which is in their Power, is the effect of Contract, Explicite or Implicite, and not of Law. So that there are no Humane Constitutive, Fundamental Laws.</q>
               <p>Proved. 1. All Laws properly so called, are the acts of such as have <hi>Governing power,</hi> obliging the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But no such Acts do constitute a Common-wealth (besides Gods Laws:) therefore no Laws constitute a Common-wealth (but Gods Laws.)</p>
               <p>The Major Proposition is past doubt. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or any that are commonly called <hi>Legislators,</hi> may call their Models and Proposals by the name of Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are enacted: But they are indeed no more so, then my words are Laws, till they shall become the acts of Authority. Those Models commonly have two parts; the first for <hi>constituting the Soveraignty;</hi> and the second fixing <hi>some immutable determinations for regulating his Government, which he may not change.</hi> But first, the constituting of the Soveraign is an act of Contract, and not of Law: And secondly so are the limitations of his Power and Rule, which are part of the Constitution, and the terms on which he doth receive it. It is no Law, till it become the Rulers act, as such.</p>
               <p>The Minor is plain. For before the Soveraignty is constituted, there is no Soveraign: For what need we make that which is already made? And where there is no Soveraign, there is no Acts of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty: that is, no Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. Legislation is a proper part of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore it supposeth the Governour consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>

               <p>Note, 1. That we take Laws here in the strict and proper sense, as distinct from Covenants: For impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as a mans Covenants oblige himself, he may be said to impose a Law upon himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we still here separate the Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from mans. Gods Authority is before and without mans consent; and he maketh by his Laws subordinate Governours over men when he pleases, obliging them to consent beforehand, being himself the Universal Soveraign, neither by Law nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. But it is only so much of the Constitution as is left to man, that I speak of.</p>

               <p>If they that have the <hi>strength,</hi> do not resist and cast off their pretender, it is to be supposed to be because they do consent: For being not from <hi>disability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him,</hi> it is to be judged to be from <hi>unwillingness.</hi> And if there were some hazard of a battle in the way, yet they that consent to scape a danger, do yet consent: But it is not all silence and non-resistance that may be called [an implicit consent.] A non-resistance forced by a <hi>Colonie</hi> or forreign Power, is no signification of consent.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170314:135"/> strong by an accidental advantage, is no signification of consent. But yet it is not the consent of the <hi>whole people</hi> that is necessary; nor alwaies of a <hi>major part:</hi> Common wealths are not alwaies to follow a Major Popular Vote. Otherwise in most cases there would be much uncertainty, which way the Major Vote inclineth. And when most are worst, and of the weaker sort, the wiser and the better will think there is no Law that subjecteth them to a Vote that's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by an inconsiderable part. If a people were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Prince, and a Major Vote choose a person to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but yet so weak and bad as might much haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the Common-wealth; and the wiser, stronger, but Minor part, do choose a wiser, better man, there appeareth no reason why the choice of the first only should be valid. (We are speaking all this while of the <hi>Constitution</hi> of a Common-wealth, where the <hi>way of Election</hi> is not yet Constituted by Agreement.) 1. The smaller number are oft of greater Interest and Possession. An hundred Lords may have more to save or lose then a thousand Peasants. 2. Nature, saith the Philosopher, made the wise to Govern the unwise; that is, They are most apt: But the smaller number are oft the wiser. 3. And the smaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is oft the better, and true to the common good. 4. And also they are oft the stronger. Ten thousand prudent valiant men, especially that are animated by the greatest interest, are usually too hard for twenty thousand silly Peasants. And I see no Reason but the Part that is both Wisest, Best, and Strongest, should be accounted the People of that Nation. Nature va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth not parts by bulk or number, but by Worth and Use: One Heart, one Stomake, one Liver, is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170314:136"/> more to be regarded then ten toes or fingers.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But who shall be Judge which part is Best if once you forsake a Major Vote, when every part think themselves the best?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Question is either of the <hi>Jus</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum:</hi> Who <hi>Ought</hi> to Judge, or who <hi>will</hi> Judge? In a company that hath no <hi>Legal Judge,</hi> the <hi>Wisest,</hi> though the <hi>Weakest, ought</hi> to <hi>Judge:</hi> For <hi>Natural Aptitude</hi> is there instead of <hi>Office,</hi> and the ignorant are obliged by God to regard his gifts in others, and to hearken to the <hi>Wise:</hi> And if the people <hi>refuse,</hi> that proveth not that they <hi>justly</hi> do refuse. But the <hi>strongest</hi> usually <hi>will</hi> Judge, though the wisest <hi>should</hi> Judge; and therefore Voting oft determineth it, because the most are supposed to be strongest, and to have most wit and Interest among them. But when it is not so, (as oft it is not) the Reason of the Voting Prevalency ceaseth (except in such cases where it is meerly for Unity and Concord) and no such stress is laid upon the Vote, but that the wise for Peace may safely yield to the unwise. When the Best by Prudence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have the greatest strength, and by Valour over-top a greater number of the bad and foolish, I know not why they should give up their welfare to their Elections. In a Ship full of Mariners and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers that have lost their Pilot and Commanders, the valiant and skilful will be loth to commit their lives to the major vote of ignorant and cowardly men, that would deliver the Vessel to the enemy, or the Rocks, or Sands.</p>
               <p>If in such a case (when there is no preobligation by Law or Contract) a Prince be chosen by the Minor Better part, (net Mercenary Souldiers, not a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170314:136"/> animated by a private Interest, nor as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) and that Part be strong enough by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their nobler Education, Prudence and Valour to enable him to Defend the Nation, and execute his Laws, against any opposition that the Rabble or rude Majority can make, I know not, <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> but that he hath a better Call, then if he had been called by the rest that were more in number.</p>
               <p>When we speak of an <hi>Implicit Consent,</hi> complying with custom, we use an improper phrase, it being a <hi>Less-express</hi> Consent that is meant by it: For if it be in no degree expressed, it falls not under humane cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.</p>
               <p>As we constantly determine against the <hi>Separatists,</hi> that such an Implicit Consent of the people, as is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified only by actual submission to Ministerial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is all that is necessary (herein) to prove the Being of a Church: So the Reason will do as much and more as to the Common-wealth; the peoples Consent being more necessary in Church matters, then in the other, because Church-Government is exercised only on <hi>Consenters.</hi> And as he may be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor that hath but such an Implicit Consent; so may he be a Prince that hath no more. When the Body of the people submit to the Government in its exercise, seeking for Justice to the Officers of him that is in Possession, and actually obeying his administrations, it importeth <hi>in foro exteriore</hi> a <hi>Consent;</hi> at least for the avoiding of greater evil; and if this be stated or in the ordinary Current as Governours are obeyed, it sufficeth to satisfie particular persons that they are obliged to obey.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 180. But if the Representative Body of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enabled thereto, shall expresly consent, and covenant with a Soveraign, the real Body submitting to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and not by any common protestation disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; it is the fullest, most regular, obliging acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, to satisfie the particular Subjects of their duty, that ordinarily can be expected.</q>
               <p>For it cannot be expected that all the Real Body should be called to Vote, and the Major Vote be well discerned, unless the disproportion be very great. Their Number, their dispersedness, and their incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities shew them very unfit to manage such a business by themselves: Their welfare requireth that it be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther managed by Prudent Representers chosen to such Ends. And then as All are Represented, so All are obliged by the consent of their Representers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 181. If a people that by Oath and Duty are obliged to a Soveraign, shall sinfully dispossess him, and contrary to their Covenants, choose and covenant with another; they may be obliged by their latter covenants, notwithstanding the former; and particular Subjects that consented not with them in the breaking of their former Covenants, may yet be obliged by occasion of their latter choice, to the person whom they choose.</q>
               <p n="1">1. As to themselves, if former violated Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses excuse men from latter, then might men by one sin be free from the incommodities of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after; for such a man that hath broke a former promise, might make an hundred inconsistent ones
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170314:137"/> afterward without being obliged by them: But no man is to have benefit by his crimes. The first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the second may be impossible to be both Performed. But yet its possible they may both <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.</hi> A man by contrary Covenants and Vows may <hi>oblige</hi> himself to Impossibilities, though he cannot <hi>perform</hi> them. He that makes an hundred covenants inconsistent with one another in the performance, sinneth as a Covenant-breaker in not performing all: though he should sin in other respects if he did perform many of them that are possible: Promises oblige whether just or unjust; But if they be unjust, they frequently cast men into a necessity of sinning; <hi>e. g.</hi> he that promiseth to give away an Orphans Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed to his Tutelage, sinneth if he do it, against the Law of fidelity and mercy; and he sinneth if he do it not as a Covenant-breaker. But when men have by contrary Covenants, cast themselves into such a Necessity of sinning, it may be a duty to choose the lesser sin, or rather to avoid the greater: And which that is, the circumstances of the Case must determine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as to others, it is most evident, that if I be innocent of the violation of a Covenant to a former Governour; then the peoples Engagement to a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may make him the just Governour, and so I may be obliged to obey him. Otherwise, 1. Few Princes on earth should be acknowledged, or people obliged to them. For the original of the succession of most or very many, was a consent that was forced from them by Power, when they were engaged to another by a former Consent. And if this obliged not the Consenters to obey the present Prince, it could not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170314:138"/> oblige their progeny, nor convey any Title to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Princes. 2. If the latter Covenant bind the guilty, it may draw an obligation on the innocent, that have a necessity of abiding in the same Common-wealth. He that cannot quit the Common-wealth, must obey the Powers that are sinfully chosen by others, as well as if they were lawfully chosen, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not his sin.</p>
               <p>That man that will conclude that the Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is necessary to the Princes Title, and that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of a people pre-engaged is valid, shall null the Title of most successive Governours (at least) on earth, and ravel the state of most Common-wealths to their confusion, contrary to all Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nero</hi> and other <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and other ancient Teachers of the Church obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and commanded others to obey (with that strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as we find in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) were some of them cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen but after possession by a party, some but implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that party; none of them more fully then such as I have here described; and few of them by a people that were not pre-engaged.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 182. When the freest people choose a Prince, they do not properly and efficiently give him his Power, as conveying it from them to him, but are only a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> and denominate or design the person that shall from God, and not from them receive it.</q>
               <p>It is the groundless confounding principle of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers in the State, and (as Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> notes) of the Church-Levellers or Separatists, that Power of Government is originally in the people, and from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170314:138"/> and by them must be conveyed to the Rulers. An opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion against Nature and Scripture; against the very essence of a Republike, that distinctly containeth So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and Subjects. I have sufficiently confuted this before by many Arguments; and shewed that the people as such, have no Power of Government. And even now I shewed you, that we discern our Ruler by such a syllogism; <hi>That person who is most agreeable to the description, and so to the will of God, must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to as Soveraign: But this is that person.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>So that the Law leaveth nothing but the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the person here undone. And therefore the people certainly doing no more but to determine of the person, do convey no power, but only do that without which it will not be conveyed; some call them <hi>Instruments;</hi> properly they are not so much, though we need not contend about the Notion; when this Corporation choose their Bayliff, they give him not a jot of Power: They are but the <hi>Causa sine qua non:</hi> the <hi>Charter</hi> is the <hi>Instrumental cause;</hi> and the <hi>Soveraign</hi> is the <hi>principal efficient cause</hi> (under God.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The people cannot give what they never received, nor had: But they never received nor had a power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning a Common-wealth, therefore they cannot give it.</hi> That it is not contained in each mans self-governing power, I have before shewed. As when a man is chosen in marriage by a woman, she giveth him not the Power of an Husband, but only chooseth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who shall from the Law of God receive it; so is it between Prince and people. God hath said in his Law, <hi>The Husband shall Rule the Wife;</hi> The woman
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170314:139"/> only adds the Minor, <hi>This man shall be my Husband.</hi> So that she <hi>gives</hi> him not the Rule, but by choosing him to be the man, is <hi>à Causa sine qua non.</hi> And if she should agree with him not to Rule her, it were <hi>ipso facto</hi> null, as being against the Law that specifieth the Relations: which sheweth that she giveth him not the power; otherwise she might restrain it or limit it. Yet here is this difference from our present case; that a woman may choose whether she will have a Husband or none: but so cannot a man choose whether he will be a member of a Common-wealth or not, except in some rare extraordinary case, that befalleth not a man among many millions.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But a servant may give his Master power over him, and what degree he please; therefore a people may give a Prince power over them: And any man may oblige himself, and thereby give another power over him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The cases are much different. <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is founded in the Law of Nature. Angels have such Order, that have no sin: But <hi>servitude</hi> is a penal fruit of sin: and no man is to choose a punishment to himself that may well avoid it: He that may be free, should choose and keep his freedom. So that the Relation of a servant is such, that a man may avoid if he can and will; and when he is necessitated to submit to it, he may limit his Master in the governing of him as far as he can and will in the matter of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude: And therefore here is a greater appearance (at least) of mans giving another the power over him, then in Political Relations constituted by God himself: And yet indeed, the matter here must more distinctly be considered. A <hi>servant</hi> is considered partly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170314:139"/> as one <hi>obliged to Work for another,</hi> and partly as the <hi>inferiour or subject in a family to be Governed by another in order to the ends of Family Government,</hi> which is the good order of the Family, for its own, and specially the Governors welfare, and the Pleasing of God that hath appointed that Order. These two are oft sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and ever distinct: Some servants are but <hi>day-Labourers,</hi> and no members of the Family, and some are <hi>members</hi> of it. Every man having a certain Power of himself and his own Labours, may alienate what he hath to another, and so by Contract sell his labour to his Master. But as he is a member of a Family sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Master in point of Morality, bound to obey him in points of duty to God and man, of the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and second, and the due circumstantiating of these duties, so the servants consent is no proper efficient cause or giver of the Masters power, but only maketh himself the object of it: So that it comes [immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately] from God, as [immediately] excludeth an intervening second efficient cause, but not [immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately] as the word excludeth all kind of <hi>Means</hi> for determination of the Object, without which the Power would not be in that person over that other person.</p>
               <p>So in point of Political Government, if there be a <hi>Domination</hi> conjunct, and the subjects submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a <hi>servitude,</hi> that <hi>indeed</hi> may be their own self-resignation, disposal or selling themselves so far to another, which is when the Governours Benefit is the principal end: (For we are not born for him.) And therefore <hi>Tyrannie</hi> and <hi>Domination</hi> of Princes are penal to the subjects, and they may escape them if they can. But proper <hi>Political Government,</hi> that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170314:140"/> is exercised over meer subjects for the publick order and Good; and the pleasing of God by Governing Justice, is Gods own Ordinance, and the Power wholly flows from him as the universal Soveraign.</p>
               <p>So that if it <hi>would</hi> hold true that from the self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and self-governing power that each individual hath by resigning all to one, he may efficiently be made a Prince or Ruler over them (which yet would be false, as I have shewed, if God were not supposed that way to convey the power, which he hath not done; Political Power being <hi>totâ specie</hi> distinct from that of self-interest, and self-Government) yet God hath left no room for this imagination and dispute, because he hath as universal King, himself instituted the Offices that shall be under him, leaving only the modifying and limiting of Circumstantials, and the determination of the persons to the will of man. And as it would be but a foolish or Trayterous arguing for a Corporation to say, [Every man hath a self-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety or interest, and a self Governing Power, which resigned to another maketh him a Governour by conveying the Power from us to him: therefore our Major or Bayliff whom we elect, doth thus receive his Authority from our gift or authorizing Act] (they having nothing left to them but the nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the man that shall receive the Authority from the Princes Law or Charter;) Even so it would be no better in any that should argue thus in the other case. If no superiour Power had gone before them by his Laws, but a City were all free from Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then indeed they might make to themselves a Prince, without the offending of any higher. And so if there were no God, (and yet man could be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170314:140"/> man) and if the world had no universal King, that had instituted offices under him by Law, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished the world into Rulers and Subjects, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the people might pretend to give the power as far as they have it to give, and be the Original of it: But when God hath given it already by a stated Law, to those that shall be lawfully nominated, the peoples claim comes in too late.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 183. As the Constitution of Common-wealths is only by Gods Laws, and mens fundamental Contracts, and not by any Fundamental Laws of men: So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that it is only <hi>God</hi> by way of <hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>parties contracting</hi> by way of <hi>Consent,</hi> that can alter the Constitutioner any part of it; and there is no <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of man that can alter it.</q>
               <p n="1">1. That the Constitution is not by humane Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, but by Contracts between Prince and People (explicit or implicit) I shewed before; and its plain in the nature of the thing. If a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour should say, <hi>[I claim the Empire, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you as Subjects to acknowledge me]</hi> yet this were no Law, because proceeding from no <hi>Authority;</hi> and the peoples Acknowledgment, though forced by such words, would be but a <hi>forced Contract.</hi> So on the other side, if a people should make a <hi>pretended Law,</hi> that such <hi>a man or company of men shall Govern them,</hi> it were indeed <hi>no Law,</hi> because from <hi>no Authority:</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Constitution there is no <hi>Legislative Power;</hi> either <hi>in Prince or People:</hi> Not in <hi>the Prince;</hi> for he is then <hi>no Prince;</hi> not in <hi>the People,</hi> for they are then <hi>no Governours,</hi> and therefore <hi>no Legislators:</hi> What have they to do to command any man to command
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170314:141"/> them, or Govern them against his will? He is as free by nature as they, and cannot justly be compelled; (much less by a Law when there are no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a known Rule, that <hi>Obligations are dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as they are Contracted:</hi> And therefore from the way of Constitution the <hi>Thesis</hi> is plain, that nothing but <hi>Gods Authority,</hi> and <hi>mens Consent,</hi> can alter it. If it be altered by proper Law, then either by the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> (whether Prince or Senate) or the <hi>Subjects:</hi> But neither by the <hi>Soveraign</hi> nor <hi>Subjects;</hi> therefore by <hi>no man.</hi> Not by the <hi>Soveraign;</hi> for 1. He is bound up by Covenant to the Constitution, and cannot by pretended Authority break his Covenants, but must stay till God or the people Contracted with, release him. 2. And his Legislation is a part of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consequential to his Power, and so to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in which he received it; and therefore hath nothing to do with that constitution, to destroy or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it that is the cause of his power, and gives it life, or is the means thereto. Else Princes when by the Constitution they are limited, might remove their bounds at pleasure. And if a <hi>Senate</hi> do it, it must be either as <hi>Rulers,</hi> or as <hi>Subjects.</hi> As <hi>Rulers</hi> they cannot alter the Constitution: For if they be <hi>Inferiour Rulers,</hi> they have no Power but from the <hi>Soveraign:</hi> If they be the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> or (as in <hi>England)</hi> have part of the Soveraignty, then they have as was proved before, no power as such to do it, any more then a <hi>Soveraign King.</hi> And as <hi>subjects</hi> they have no Power to do it: For <hi>subjects</hi> have none such. 1. They had not Power <hi>by Law to Constitute the Government,</hi> nor by any force, but by Consent of him or them
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170314:141"/> whom they chose to Rule them; therefore they have no other Power to <hi>dissolve</hi> it. 2. <hi>Subjects</hi> are bound to obey, and have as such no Legislative Power; therefore much less have they any to alter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution by.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 184. If Prince, Senate, or People alone (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by certain providence have disobliged them, and dissolved the Government) shall of themselves without the Consent of the other part, dissolve or change the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, they perfidiously destroy the Foundation, (if it be in the substantial points) and put themselves into a state of enmity with the other part.</q>
               <p>But of this more, when we come to speak of the Dissolution of Common-wealths.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 185. Yet may the first Constitution of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth be in many particulars changed by degrees, when Prince and People do Consent: But if those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents shall be called by the name of Laws, thus far they are none indeed, but Contracts.</q>
               <p n="1">1. That Constitutions may be gradually and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually changed (possibly, but not fitly) is evident: Because as Consent of the chief Governour and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sufficed to the <hi>Constitution,</hi> so doth it suffice to the <hi>alteration.</hi> The same cause may produce the like effect; for here is no impediment. And therefore we need not in this Land go to the Original of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to know the Constitution: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is to be found that Prince and people have thus
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170314:142"/> or thus Consented, so much of the Constitution is there found.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In a Law</hi> this change of the Constitution may be found: but it is not it self any part of a Law. A Parliament may have a double capacity: To be <hi>Soveraign</hi> (in whole, or part) and to be the <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> of the people: They <hi>Represent the people,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>simply as people,</hi> to preserve their Rights accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Constitution; or else <hi>as subjects.</hi> A Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of <hi>subjects, as such,</hi> have no Power of making Laws, nor by Contract altering the Constitution: A Representative of <hi>People,</hi> or a <hi>Community,</hi> as such, may have power to preserve their Rights, and by <hi>Contract</hi> to change the Constitution, but none to <hi>make Laws:</hi> A Parliament as <hi>Soveraign,</hi> have Power to make Laws, but none by a Law to alter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. But when the Parliament hath <hi>several ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,</hi> their Instrument may accordingly have a various nature and use, and in part it may be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> with the Prince, themselves Representing the people, and so it may Gradually alter the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in part it may be a <hi>Law</hi> imposed by the whole Soveraignty. And in the Instrument called a Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of the Government may be made by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of both parties.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 186. If by later Consent between Prince and People, the antient Constitution be changed, or any part of it, it is the last Consent alone that bindeth the Prince and Subjects as nulling the contrary former Contract; and it is perfidiousness to violate the last Consent, upon pretence of recurring to the first constitution.</q>

               <p>AT his first Creation man was subjected to none but God: though it was provided in Nature, that there should have been Government and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction though man had continued innocent: but that would have been only a Paternal assisting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our good▪ having nothing in it that is penal, or any way evil. When God immediately Ruled, and man obeyed, all went right: Had this continued, the world had not felt those fractures and wounds, nor been troubled with rapines, wars or confusion, as it is. God being most perfectly Wise and Just, could not err in Commanding: Man was innocent and able to obey, but free and mutable: and so was tempted from his Obedience. Satan by disobedience having overthrown himself, did know it was the way to overthrow man. God could not be corrupted, nor tempted to unwise or unrighteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170314:143"/> could not have decayed. But Satan knew which was the weakest link in the chain: Man was frail, though holy; and not confirmed yet, though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: and therefore defectible. The attempt of breaking his rank, and forsaking his due subjection, was the Devils fall: and by the same way he assaulted man, inciting in him a desire to be <hi>as God,</hi> and then provoking him to seek it by disobeying God: A foolish means to an impossible or impious end. The breach being thus made between man and his universal King, the joynts of holy order were loosed; and a breach was made also between man and himself, and man and the inferiour creatures, and enmity and confusion took possession in the world. The creatures Rebell against their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They divide their Interest from their Peoples; and live as if their peoples welfare were not <hi>theirs;</hi> but rather all that is taken from the Subject, is added unto them. The soul and body of most Common-wealths fall out; and the Head and Heart have such diseased obstructions and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are their mutual torment, and the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks of their hastening dissolution: when the Ivie hath kill'd the tree that bore it, it must perish with it. And if they are first themselves dismounted, they seldom ever get into the saddle, and sit fast after it.</p>
               <p>Some Nations have thought that the way, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, was to be <hi>free;</hi> that is, to be <hi>Self-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;</hi> and so when All governed, they found that none Governed, but Tyrannie and all Vice did raign in popular confusions: and there was neither peace nor safety to the whole or parts; No waves being greater then the Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The sence of the mischief of Democracie hath made others think that the best way is to leave Kings to their wills, and let them use their Power arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: They think it costeth the world more to limit Princes then its worth: and that if they are absolute, their Interest will lead them to cherish their people: Or if they should grow cruel, God will protect us, and turn it to the best: A hundred sheep will flye from a little curre; and yet the Shepherd takes care that few of them are destroyed.] I could the easier digest this Doctrine, were it not for these Reasons.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170314:145"/> 1. The Heart of man is deceitful and desperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and what will it not do, if it may do what it will? 2. When men know that they are lyable to no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, it will let loose their lusts, and make them worse. 3. We may not tempt them thus into a life of sin, to their own destruction. 4. Nor must we tempt God by pretending to trust him in a neglect of means. 5. It is against the light of Nature that one mans will should ruine a Nation. 6. If we may give away our Bodily welfare, yet not our souls. The Princes interest may lead him to have some regard to the Bodily welfare of the people, but he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their souls. Greatness will have great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And when there is no restraint, this will make the Greatest to be the worst. And the worst men are enclined to the worst opinions, and to be the greatest enemies to Piety and Honesty; and so would banish Christianity into corners, or from the earth. 7. If we might give away our own Interest, we may not so give away Gods; nor encourage or suffer every deceived wicked Prince to do as the Infidel Princes do, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute Christianity out of their Dominions. 8. At least we may not be guilty of Treason against God, by consenting to an Idol, or Usurper that claimeth his prerogative, and pretendeth to an absolute unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Power, as if he were from under the Laws and Government of the Almighty: we must know no Power but whats from God; and therefore none against his undoubted Interest and Laws. As it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to submit to the Pope that thus usurpeth in the Church, so as unlawful to consent to any Anti-Gods usurpation in the Common-wealth. 9. And the experience of the world hath caught them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170314:145"/> unlimited Government, even as intolerable to the people: For though they should no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> destroy the <hi>whole penple,</hi> yet at their pleasure their <hi>particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> must be the fuel of their rage &amp; lust. Every mans Estate, Wife or Daughter that they have a mind to, must be theirs; and their word must command the Heads of the best deserving Nobility to the block: And however the distant vulgar speed, those that are nearest them will be as Lambs before the Wolf. 10. And experience hath told the world, that there is many, and very many bad Kings for one good one throughout the world; and the wicked will do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly when they have no restraint. And therefore this were to deliver up the Kingdoms of the earth to Satan, who Ruleth by the wicked; when we have a promise that they shall be the <hi>Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ,</hi> that <hi>Ruleth</hi> especially by the <hi>holy and the just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others have thought it a hopeful way of Cure, to have the Government elective, and either <hi>quam diu bene se gesserint,</hi> or for a short continuance by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But these have found that the Remedy was insufficient. The Nations of the earth have but few men that are wise and good: and if those must Rule but a little while, the bad will succeed them: And if it must run through many, and so there be many bad Rulers for one good one, the bad ones will do more hurt then the good ones can do good. And it will be next impossible so to temper the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that bad Rulers may have power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Common-wealth, and yet not have power to perpetuate themselves, and invade a perpetual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatorship with <hi>Caesar;</hi> For Armies they must have;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170314:146"/> and those that can get sufficient interest in them, may use them to their own ends. Some think that the wealthier peoples bearing Arms would prevent all this: for they would never serve a Tyrant against their Liberties. Much should be done I confess more then is, this way, to preserve the peoples Liberties: but yet the Remedy is inconsiderable. For 1. We must have our Armies abroad, and those will be the poor, and those will be mercenary, and return to serve their Commanders minds. 2. Flattering words will mislead them that are not mercenary. 3. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and Wealth doth effiminate men and make them cowardly. 4. Experience told us in our late Wars, that the trayn'd Bands were as ready, at least in most places, to follow the stronger side that was in place, as the poorer Volunteers were: For they thought they had somewhat more to lose then their younger sons or servants had; and therefore they would not venture to disobey the strongest.</p>
               <p>Some think a Lot being a Divine decision, to be the only way to choose the Prince: which hath its place, but solveth not the difficulty without more ado. To use Lots among a company of bad or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just men to find one good one, is a tempting God; and but like the casting a Net among Frogs to catch Fish. The materials must be first prepared, and the main secured.</p>
               <p>In a word, many models have been devised, and most of them have their excellencies, and defects: Some of them secure the peoples wealth and liberty from a Tyrant, and lay them open to an invading enemy: Some of them free the people from oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by a Prince, and leave them under a multitude
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170314:146"/> of Oppressors: Some so secure Liberty as to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in justice and confusion: and certainly cast away the means of spiritual everlasting good, in order to preserve their temporal good. And most of them tread under foot the Government and Interest of the Universal King, and pretend the means agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

They that can do most to mend the people, and secure us of good Rulers, and so to secure us in the main matters of Religion and Peace, are the best Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians, though they leave us many inconveniences. And to that end he that could cull out the best of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mode, and leave the worst, woold shew his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Because I pretend not to such skil, nor intend any accurate Tract of Politicks, nor the discovery of an <hi>Ʋtopia,</hi> or <hi>City of the Sun,</hi> nor intend to bestow that time and labour which is necessary to improve that little knowledge that I have, to any such ends; but only to urge upon the world the great Divine neglected Principles, that we may be secured of the main; I shall readily give place to any of their new devised Models that are consistent with these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and leave them to beautifie the Common-wealth in their own wayes, if the Life of it may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by Gods way.</p>
               <p>And yet I must say that for ought I see, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Common-wealth is already ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with as much prudence, caution, and equality, (though with less ado) as the curiousest of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels that self-conceited men would obtrude with so much ostentation.

Of this having spoken before, I shall yet add somewhat more, to shew you how the Kingdoms of the world may be made the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ.</p>

               <p>The Ultimate End is the chief Good: This deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth all the Means to be more or less Good, and all things to be Indifferent, as to Amiableness, that are neither for it, nor against it; and all things to be Evil that are against it. That which is neither our End, nor a means to our End, is not Good or Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us. Food and rayment and our outward wealth, are to furnish our own and others bodies with such requisites as fit them for the serving of our souls, that both may serve God, and enjoy and please him. He that takes down this End (the Pleasing and Enjoying of God in Glory) takes down all the world as a means to it, and destroyeth the very use and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative nature of all things under the Sun, and makes

               <p>Though the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as such oblige us not; yet the matter of it under another form may oblige; that is, the Moral Law still bindeth us, both as the Law of Nature, and of the Redeemer: And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Law commonly called Political, (though indeed the Moral were Political) do still bind, so far as our case agreeing with theirs, we can perceive in those Laws how God would have such a case deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. If Gods Laws keep not the preheminency, his Government is rejected. He ruleth by Laws; and to reject them is to reject his Rule. All the world have the Law of Nature; Christians also have the Law of Grace, and the Law of Nature in the most legible Characters.

By this it appeareth that in a true Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, or Divine Common wealth, the Matter of the Church and Common-wealth should be altogether or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the same, though the form of them and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are different.</q>
               <p n="1">1. That the materials or subjects should be the same, appeareth from what is said: They must all be such as enter the Covenant with God, which in a Christian Common-wealth can be no other then the Baptismal Covenant which entereth them into the Church; Circumcision entered them by the holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into Church and Common-wealth, which among the Jews were materially the same. He that is by the Covenant given up to God in Christ, is a member of Gods Universal Church and Kingdom. Yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Universal Church, and the Universal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the strict sense, are both materially and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all one; though the particulars are not so. There are three senses of Gods Universal Kingdom. 1. As the word signifieth all that are obliged as subjects to obey him; and so all men, even Rebels are members of his Kingdom. 2. As it signifieth those that obey him <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or analogically, but not simply and acceptably, (nor profess so much.) And so Turks and many Infidels that worship God, but not by Christ, are in his Kingdom. 3. As it comprehendeth only faithful accepted subjects, and those that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession seem to be such: And thus his Kingdom, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170314:151"/> his Church Universal are all one formally.</p>

When we are once come down below God the fountain in our observation, we find a present Division of that Communicable Power into many hands, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the incommunicable Power that is in God alone. For man hath not Gods sufficiency to be all. The Popes flatterers may extol him as an Universal V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therefore though the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Kingdom (in the strict sense) and the Universal Church are One, in O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e God, yet <hi>particular</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Churches are diversified <hi>in specie,</hi> as shall anon be shewed.</p>
               <p>When I say that the matter (ordinarily) should be the same, I mean not to tye the Governours of Church or State, to a necessary conformity of their administrations as to the matter, in taking in or cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of members (save only in point of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and conveniency, to be mentioned in the next chapter.) For each sort of Governours have the charge of their own distinct administrations. It is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170314:152"/> not only possible, but too common, that one sort is much more careless and unsaithful to God and men then the other. If a good Magistrate have bad Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours over the same people, and the Pastors will not difference between the precious and the vile, but will keep the impious and filthy in the Church, the Magistrate is not therefore bound to keep such as Free men in the Commonwealth, but must make it (as containing Free men) narrower then the Church. And if faithful Pastours live under a careless Prince that takes the filthyest and most impious as <hi>Cives,</hi> the Pastours must not do so in the Church; for they must be accountable to God for the discharge of their own trust.</p>
               <p>But that which I mean, is, that the same Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maketh a man capable of being a member both of a Christian Church and Common-wealth, which is, his Covenant with God in Christ, or his Membership of the Universal Church, supposing the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials or accidental capacities which are indeed distinct.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Note that I exclude not some just excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ordinary or extraordinary Cases, in which the Members of one sort of Society may be excluded from the other. Persons that are through scruples (innocent or sinful) kept from joyning with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church for a time, being yet capable of their Communion, may be yet members of the Common-wealth. Want of Riches may do more also to keep men out of Freedom in the Common-wealth, then out of the Church. And yet I think that in a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie care should be taken to keep some members from swelling to excess, and others from extremity
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170314:152"/> of want, as among the Israelites there was; yet so as no mans industry be discouraged, nor propriety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, nor idleness in any cherished. And Riches and Poverty should not make altogether so great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as they do in Prophane societies. If mens Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be not so great as to make them the servants of others, and deprive them of <hi>ingenuous Freedom,</hi> it should not deprive them of <hi>Civil Freedom:</hi> especially where Criminal and Civil cases have different Judges, they may have more <hi>Freedom</hi> about <hi>Criminals</hi> then <hi>Civils.</hi> Where wealth is concerned, men of wealth should have the power: but where Vertue or Vice, Honesty or Dishonesty is the matter of debate, the Honest though poor, should have more power than the Impious that are rich.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore that though variety of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward States, and the neglects of either Magistrate or Pastours, may be an exception to the Rule, yet as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward qualifications, ordinarily the same persons are fit to be Members of Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>But as the Church hath only the members within, and yet the <hi>Competentes,</hi> and <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and in a more distant sort, the excommunicate, and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Infidels, under her care, as owing them some help; so a Christian Common-wealth, though it own none as <hi>Cives,</hi> (or free subjects, commonly called Burgesses, or enfranchised persons) but such as are fit to be Church-members, yet hath it many that are meer subjects, and are to have the protection of the Laws for their lives and possessions, that are of a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet that Church and Common-wealth are not formally (nor <hi>de facto</hi> alwayes, nor usually mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially

The Magistrate Ruleth imperiously, and by force, having power upon mens estates and persons: But the Pastours have none such, but govern only by the Word of God explained and applyed to the Conscience. 3. <hi>From the nearest Foundation.</hi> The Common-wealth is constituted by a (virtual or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) contract between the civil Soveraign and the People: But the Church (particular) is constituted, by a consent between the Pastours and the Flock. 4 <hi>From the extent.</hi> The Common-wealth containeth all the people in a whole Nation or more, as united in one Soveraign. But particular Churches (distinct from the universal united in Christ) have no general Ecclesiastical Officers in whom a Nation must unite as one Church; but as Corporations in one Kingdom; or as so many Schools, that have a peculiar form and Government; but such only as is under the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Government in its kind: or as several Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in one University. 5. <hi>From the accidental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacities of men to be members of each.</hi> A Servant or Beggar is to <hi>be</hi> a free member of the Church, that is to be limited much more in his freedom in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170314:153"/> being a member of a particular Church, who yet may be a member of the Common-wealth. 6. <hi>From the Nearest end.</hi> Civil Order is the Nearest end of civil Polity: but Church Order, for holy Communion in Gods worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I am my self as meerly Neutral in it as in almost any point of so great moment so often propounded to my consideration: I oppose them not in the least, nor am I for them: Not from a carelesness or unwillingness to know the truth, but the difficulty of the case, and the weakness of my
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170314:154"/> understanding. I live in hope of the coming and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, and pray that he may come quickly: But that he will after his coming raign Visibly on earth, and if so, in what manner, are things that I have read much of, but am uncertain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, and scarce can perceive which way my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment most inclineth.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, why should we not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire in our longings after that Raign of Christ, and Dignity of the Saints, and Reformation of the world, which is undoubtedly our duty, and which all agree about that have the fear of God?</p>
               <p>If there be such a thing as a visible Raign of Christ here to be expected, he will surely elevate his servants in their Capacities of Soul and Body, as well as in their Dignity of Rule: And therefore we have little now to do study, and wait, and pray for that Kingdom that is to come.

Nor can they rationally dream that the most uncharitable (that is, in Christs sense, the most graceless sort) that can censure and condemn all others as no Saints, and appropriate holiness causlesly to themselves,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170314:154"/> should therefore have the Rule of others. If Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Rules not, Christ Rules not. 3. Nor can they expect sure that all and only Saints shall be Princes, Judges, or other Magistrates: For then the World were worse an hundred fold then now. For now we have thousands of Saints that are Subjects; and then all the Subjects must be supposed wicked, and no Saints, and we must have no more Saints but enow to Rule: And if we had materially such wicked Common-wealths, it would bring the plagues of God upon us: And if Government of Saints do no more Good in the World but to leave all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wicked, it were liker Satans Government then Christs. It is certain therefore that it is not <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>some</hi> of the Saints that must be Governours; and so it is already; and that it may be much <hi>Better,</hi> and that secured to our Posterity, should be now our joint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.

The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> have called us to restore and practise Confirmation, and not take all into the number of Adult members that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in Infancy, and never knew Christ nor a godly life. I could say the like of other Parties that have lately risen up. One sort runneth to them, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part raileth at them; but he is the wise man that knoweth how to receive from them so much as is good, and leave the rest: could we duly improve them, we might have cause to thank God (though not them) that ever he permitted such occasions of our Reformation. So may I say in particular of the <hi>Millenaries:</hi> If we could by them be awakened to promote the unquestionable Raign of Christ, what a mercy would ensue?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 208. It is no meer frame or mode of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democraty, or mixt, whether the Roman, Spartan, Venetian, or any other Mode, that will make happy a Common-wealth in the hands of imprudent, impious men, so much as one of the other forms; supposed worse, will do in the hands of men of prudence, and the fear of God.</q>
               <p>A great stir is made by Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> and other self-conceited Polititians for their several forms. No contrivances are of much moment to our happiness, but those that secure us of a succession of good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. These particulars I shall here briefly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170314:155"/> manifest. 1. That their contrivances tend not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us of such a succession, nor a present faithful Government. 2. That imprudent and bad men in their contried form will undo the people. 3. That prudent faithful men in other forms, are likely to be a blessing to the people.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Leviathan, or way of absolute Impious Monarchy, making us, our Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tendeth not to secure us of a Righteous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a point that needeth no proof with any reasonable man; were it but because the irreligious Author pretendeth not to any such thing as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a succession of the Christian Religion, without which a Righteous Government is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Harringtons</hi> Oceana, and Venetian Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, have no such tendency, is plain. 1. In that it is such a Government as Heathens have been our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in, and in which he thinks they have excelled us, that he propoundeth. And therefore doubtless he intendeth not that his frame shall secure us the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, without which we can have no happy Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And he professeth himself that his <hi>Common-wealth is most inconsistent with a Clergy:</hi> without which the Christian Religion never was maintained in any Nation upon earth. And Christ saith to his Ministers, whom he promised to be with to the end of the world, that he that despiseth them, despiseth him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. And as Christ never Ruled since his Ascension but by his Officers, Word and Spirit; so he that purposely designeth the extirpation of his Officers, intendeth not his Raign, or at least promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170314:156"/> it not. And he that is an enemy to the Raign of Christ, at he is the heir of wrath himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. so would he make others, and therefore murder the Common-wealeh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He thinketh <hi>Venice,</hi> where Popery Ruleth, and whoredom abounds, is the perfectest Pattern of Government for us, now existent: therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not sure that his Model should keep us from the Raign of Popery (or whoredom.) I doubt not but the same Model among better men, might do much against them: which doth but shew that it is not the <hi>Model,</hi> but the <hi>better men</hi> that must do most.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The whole scope of the design is by the Ballot and Rotation to secure us from the danger of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of being Ruled by Wise or Honest men, and put the business out of doubt, that strangers to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and enemies to Piety shall be our ordinary Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and consequently Christianity be expelled. Can you doubt of this? 1. He knoweth not what Prudence and Piety are, or knoweth not <hi>England</hi> or mankind, that knoweth not that the Major part of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are scarcely Prudent and Pious men. 2. He knoweth not what Piety is, that knoweth not that Impious men abhor it; and he is not a Christian, that neither believeth the Prologue to the first Covenant of Grace; that saith, <hi>God will put enmity between the Womans and the Serpents seed,</hi> which the first born man shewed in <hi>killing his brother, because his own works were evil, and his brothers Righteous.</hi> 1 John 3. 12. Nor yet believeth the words of Christ, that his <hi>servants will be hated of all men for his sake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not of the world,</hi> &amp;c. 3. And he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170314:156"/> not <hi>Oceana</hi> (Mr. <hi>Harringtons</hi> Common-wealth) that knoweth not that the ignorant and ungodly rabble are made the Lords and <hi>Rulers</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>Go to the Foundation, and follow it up to the Head, and Judge. In his first Order, <hi>pag.</hi> 58. in the distribution into <hi>freemen and servants,</hi> all are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that can live of themselves. 2. In his second Order, the younger sort are made the <hi>marching Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the Elder the <hi>Garrisons.</hi> 3. In the third, by their estates they are distributed into the <hi>Equestrian Order and the foot;</hi> only those that have prodigally spent their estates are excluded Suffrages and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 4. His fourth Order settleth the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, Hundreds and Tribes. 5. His fifth Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Parish Ballot; where all above thirty years of age are to choose their Deputies by suffrage: when in most Parishes its too well known that the Major part are Ignorant men, and too many enemies to Piety, and many to common sobriety and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. In some Parishes you may go to five, if not ten families, before you meet with one that can so much as read (though I hope that is not the common case) And in abundance of them, the multitude are so edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, that beyond the matters of their Ploughs, and Carts, and Trades, they are scarce men, and can scarce speak sense. And of all men, the rabble hate both Magistrates and Ministers that would bring them up to Piety, and restrain them from a licentious sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual life. And of all their Neighbours, they most hate them that live an holy Heavenly life, and condemn them by their difference.</p>
               <p>And <hi>operari sequitur esse;</hi> such as men are, so they will act; and such if they are freemen, they will
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170314:157"/> choose: will they choose wise and Godly men that partly hate them, and partly know not the worth of Wisdom? Would they choose those Magistrates that they know would punish them, and whom they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor for strictness, and for punishing Vice?</p>
               <p n="6">6. In his sixth Order, two parts in three in every Parish must be for the Minister: And how many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes be they where a bad man that will suit their humours, shall sooner have two parts, then a godly faithful Pastor? And <hi>pag.</hi> 65 He provideth that there be no excommunication to make a difference, but Heaven and Hell must be confounded; forsooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that excommunication is not clearly proved out of Scripture to such capacities as his.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His seventh Order gives us Justices of Peace, Jury-men, Captains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by these suffrages. And the choosers may tell us what kind of Justices and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains they will be. 8. His eighth Order giveth us Horse and Foot-Captains by a Ballot, that its ten to one, know as well how to perform their trust as I know how to guide a ship that was never in one. And as wisely might our Parishes and their Deputies by the Major Vote elect us Pilots and Captains of ships out of stables, and barns, and Cow-houses, as thence elect us Land-Captains and Magistrates. So his ninth and tenth Orders carry on the same work, by giving us Magistrates out of Shops and Threshing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floores. They must elect us the Philarch, the Lord Lieutenant (perhaps my Lord Ale-seller, or my Lord Plow-jogger) the <hi>Custos Rotulorum,</hi> &amp;c. the Philarch must keep the Quarter-Sessions, and hear causes in order to the protection of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, who partly know not what Conscience is, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170314:157"/> partly hate nothing more then Conscience, though they love nothing more then Liberty. No Tribe may Petition a Parliament, unless the Philarch at the Councel frame the Petition, and propose it by clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, unto the Ballot of the whole Tribe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are like then to have good Petitions, and comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from Parliaments: When a pack of the rabble are got together, that lately had got the name of [Damn-me's] that took him for a Puritane that spoak a sentence without [God damn me] in it; and no man shall put up a Petition to the Parliament, but by their Counsel and proposal and Consent; then we have a perfect Common-wealth! Were it not for fear of abusing the name of God and Holiness, I would here by prediction, draw you up one of their Petitions; but I dare not so far defile my Paper, and the Readers eyes. I am ashamed and a weary to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this gang any further, and shew you what Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments we must have, that being fetched from the Dung-cart to make us Laws, and from the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house and the May-pole to dispose of our Religion, Lives and Estates, can scarce tell whether the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a rational Law be humane and intelligible; and if they read such a Law, they scarce know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be English, but better understand them that bleat and bellow, then they do these Law-terms. Or if there be a cunning Knave among them, its he that shall be the Prince and lead the rest. When I lately heard a description of the Irish, I was thinking how gallantly they would Rule or choose us Rulers by Vote, especially in Religion; when they know so much of Christ as to tell us that he is a better man then Saint <hi>Patrick;</hi> and so much of the Devil, as to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170314:158"/> call him Knave, and thats a great part of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And yet this is not all; but Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> will give the people the supremacy and last resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thats better of the two, then to give it to the Devil, or to worship the old Egyptian gods, an Ox or an Onion: Get all the Nobility and Gentry first to put it to the Countreys Vote, who shall be possessors of their Lands and Lordships: Or get all the learned and Wise men in Philosophy, Physick, Law, Theology, to put it to the Vote how these shall be regulated and used▪ The best use that we have in <hi>England</hi> for popular power of judging, is by Juries, that we think preserve our Liberties: And yet (I shall say again) I have thought of the excellency of a Democracie, when I have sat and heard a Learned Judge opening a hard case of Titles to the Jury, and they have stood by him all the while as if he had been talking Greek and Hebrew to them, and gone their way and brought in a Verdict for Plaintiff or Defendant at a venture, as it first came to their Tongues-ends, before they understood the cause any more then the man in the Moon; unless there were a crasty fellow among them, and then he ruled all the rest, and he had the day that had his voyce. Which when I saw, I thought it in such difficult cases almost as good to throw the Dice to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> doubts not but the people will be wise enough to choose the wise, and good enough to choose the good. As if we knew not what hard, and scornful, and censorious thoughts the vulgar have of Nobility, Learning, and all that is above them. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at reproaches do we daily hear from them,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170314:158"/> not only against Divines, but against Lawyers, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, Princes, and all whose waies they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with? Many a time have I heard them say, [It will never be a good world, while Knights and Gentlemen make us Laws, that are chosen for fear, and do but oppress us, and do not know the peoples sores: It will never be well with us till we have Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Country-men like our selves, that know our w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts.] Nothing more natural, then that the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation should be of the kind: and that sensual and ungodly men should choose such as themselves, and as will fit their ends: Especially being now exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by a war and some attempts of Reformation, they will be more virulent then heretofore, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will satisfie them but the extirpation of those that have crost them, and would have reformed them.</p>
               <p>It is easie to bring such on the stage in a dreaming Model, and put a golden Oration into their mouthes, and feign a fool more eloquent then <hi>Demosthenes:</hi> but when it comes to the execution (if the Nation be so distracted as to try) it will not be found so easie a matter to reach the Elected to speak sense: but the Senate and the Prerogative tribe must presently be put upon wielding the great affairs of Government, Civil and Religions, of Peace and War, which they are utterly ignorant of, as never being exercised in before. If these Polititians will scorn to be equalled in the reputation of their Learning with unstudied men that never took any pains to get it; (yea or to be matcht in point of <hi>Prudence</hi> by <hi>Divines</hi> that study its likely much more then themselves, if so be they have but read more of some parts of History or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170314:159"/> though they are ignorant of the principal parts of solid learning;) why then should we equalize unskilful Rusticks that never studied Politicks a day, but are suddenly chosen from the Plough or Alehouse by the vulgar vote, with men that have studied and been trayned up to the skill of Governing, and been exercised in it? Surely if Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> be so much a wiser man as he proclaims himself then the Clergy, as may warrant him to give it us as the suffrage of the Nations (pag. 223.) that <hi>[An ounce of Wisdom is worth a pound of Clergie]</hi> and that <hi>[Ministers of all others least understand Political Principles];</hi> if all the Clergy, though they are men of the same Country and complexion with himself, and have studied many hours for his one, cannot yet come near the eminence of his wisdom, no nor attain to so much knowledge of Political Principles as all others have (in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;) we must then expect to be Governed by a constant Miracle, or by constant folly, when men that never studied such things are made our Governours. Are Divines all such fools for all their studies? and will the Plough-mens Vote immediately give us a Senate and Prerogative tribe of wise men! wise in matters of highest moment, that they never heard of or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with before.</p>
               <p>And lest we should have any hope they should grow wiser by experience, the Rotation must turn them out before they well know where they are, and what it is they were Called to do; and from the Academy of the Shop or Alehouse, we must have freshmen in their rooms that are as wise as they were. What Ship was well Governed that was thus used in choice of Pilots? What Army was prosperous that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170314:159"/> was thus used in choice of Commanders? What School was well taught that was thus used in choice of School-masters? to have the ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exercised introduced, and then turned out before they can grow wise, to secure us against all possibility of remedy.</p>
               <p>But though the National Religion and Conscience must be thus disposed of; yet Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> and his Brethren (they know why) do haply secure us of <hi>libtrty of conscience,</hi> and that of a sufficient latitude that <hi>[No gathered Congregations be molested or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their way of worship, being neither Jewish nor Idolatrous, but vigilantly and vigorously protected,</hi> &amp;c. pag. r 30.] Popery had been before excepted, but that found place for repentance; and now Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his fraternity have Liberty, either never to worship God at all (for that's supposed to be free) or to set up Deism, and worship God without a Saviour, or to set up Mahometanism, or cry down Christ and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or to make a worship of preaching up impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vice, and crying down the Scriptures and all true Worship. I will not talk of such low things as Liberty to preach down the Godhead or manhood of Christ, the Creation, the Resurrection and Life to come, and other Articles of the faith, by parts. But if he felt not some extream necessity of such Liberty, there need not this excessive care to secure it. What need all this ado for liberty of such Consciences, when the major Vote of the impious Rule, who will not only grant you Liberty, but extirpate those that for the defence of Christianity would deprive you of it?</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It seems then there is an Instance of a worthy King that was taken from a Sheepfold: But to have <hi>many hundred</hi> persons so prepared for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p n="3">3. But its well known that in those dayes, when Countries lay open, and mens treasure lay in Cattle rather then in Gold, that Herdsmen and Shepherds were the greatest men, and fittest for Riches to be Princes.</p>

Mr. <hi>Harringtons</hi> Model hath not yet made them <hi>Independants;</hi> and therefore they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily choose such as their Landlords do desire them to choose; and therefore it will go according to the quality of the <hi>Landlords,</hi> and not according to the quality of the <hi>people,</hi> 2. Formerly when the peoples Liberties were encroacht on, and no divisions made in the Land among the Gentry, they were all ready to joyn for the common liberty, with some more una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity then now. But now by the late wars they are divided, and one part think themselves oppressed, and the attempts of Reformation have irritated the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual gang; there wants nothing but Liberty, to tread these Reformers in the dirt. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his party get down the Army, and take off all the late restraints,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170314:161"/> and let Parliaments be chosen by unrestrained Votes, and that party that hath most tenants, and that is most against Puritans, that will carry it. 3. And even before the divisions and exasperations, the divided Parliament and the war ensuing, and Major part of the Nobility and Gentry adhering to the King, (who by a minor part were conquered) did shew us what a Vote would have done. So much to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>

Having shewed that these new Models secure us not of a Righteous Government, (though there is much good interwoven, which by righteous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors might be made good use of,) I should next shew that the <hi>Imprudent and Evil will not be hindred by these Forms, from undoing the Common-wealth.</hi> And for that, what need I more, then, 1. That men at liberty will rule according to their dispositions? An evil tree bringeth not forth good fruit. Men gather not grapes of thorns, nor figgs of thistles. Folly will not do the works of Wisdom, nor Impiety cherish Godliness which it hateth. Why else do not Heathens, Turks and all Infidels set up Christianity, but because they are against it? and as much are ungodly sensual men, though called Christians, against true Piety. 2. What is there to hinder them? Is it Laws, who made them? It is they themselves that are the Law-givers. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>it</hi> be a Monarchie, Aristocracie, or Democracie, the Soveraign is the Law-giver. They are also the Judges of the Law, having none above them: So that in making, repealing and executing Laws, what mischief may they not do, especially which the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual multitude can but bear?</p>
               <p>Name us that Common-wealth on earth that is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Ruled by impious Rulers, and Prudently
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170314:162"/> Ruled by fools, whatever the Model of Government may be.</p>
               <p>And to what use are all their Models, if not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us of good and righteous Governours? Is it any better to be impiously and unrighteously Governed by a thousand then by one? If therefore it secure not this, but rather certainly destroy it, their Model is poor relief or comfort to an oppressed undone people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next part of my task here is to shew you, that in every Form, whether Monarchy, Aristocracie, or Democratie, wise and pious righteous Governors will make the Government a blessing to the people. For, 1. They will act according to their Principles: But the Principles of all wise and pious men, do lead them to prefer God and the Common Good, before any private interest of their own; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. They will act according to their <hi>Dispositions:</hi> But honesty and wisdom <hi>disposes</hi> them to prefer God and the common good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors will Rule according to the attraction of their Ultimate End. But every wise and honest man doth make God his Ultimate End, (and the nearer End the Common Good.)</p>
               <p>Holiness is a new Nature: and therefore a constant Monitor and mover unto Good. They that Love God and Vertue, and hate all evil, will Rule accordingly.</p>
               <p>Its true, they are imperfect, and have their faults: but that which is predominant in their hearts, will be predominant in their Government.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 209. From hence the common Question may be resolved, Whether it be better to be Ruled by good Laws and bad Governors, or by good Governors and bad Laws?</q>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:170314:162"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is as if you should ask, Is it better be warmed by cold snow, or cooled by the fire? Laws are nothing but acts of Government; effects and significations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours will concerning what shall be the subjects Duty. Laws antecedent to the Soveraigns will, are effects before the cause. Good Rulers will make &amp; continue good Laws, and bad ones the contrary. All the world have good Laws already made them by God: But if you will needs suppose a separation, I say, that Good Laws with bad Rulers will do little good, but restrain a little of their evil: But if the inferiour Magistrates only be bad, the Good Rulers and Laws that are over them may force them to do good.</p>
               <p>Gods Laws are the effect and significations of his Will. And his Will and Power are before his Laws: The Laws of the Common-wealth that are made by men, are the effects and signs of the Wills of the Law givers: Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>slation is the chief act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and highest prerogative of Governing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Contracts may be antecedent to Government, but Law cannot. When the Individual Ruler dyeth, the Laws survive, not as effects of Contract, or effect without a cause, nor as his Laws that is dead, but as his Laws that doth succeed, who owneth them (as by the Contract he is obliged) as soon as he succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: The Soveraign liveth <hi>in specie</hi> in the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to whomsoever the Power is divolved, his acts do the Laws become, and as soon as he disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, they are null (though the constitutive Contracts are not so.) Where Kings only are the Law-givers, or Senates only, or both conjunct, they have power over the Laws, to repeal them. And bad Soveraigns, (if no restraint be in on them) will make
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170314:163"/> bad Laws, and good ones will make goods Laws.</p>
               <p>And if fundamental Contracts limit the Soveraign, if he can, he will violate them, if vice dispose him to it, and carnal Interest entice him. And how hard it is to execute limiting Contracts effectually for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint that hath got possession of strength and Soveraignty, is commonly known.</p>
               <p>And if the Laws were good, and the superiour power so good as to make them, but not so good as to be much regardful for the execution, then if the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magistrates be naught, they will make nothing of the Laws. Who knoweth not how easily impious Judges and Justices can destroy the just, and turn most righteous Laws against them, by mis-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and mis-applications? Saith <hi>Plautus</hi> in Trin. act. 4. <hi>Mores leges jam perduxerunt in potestatem su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am; Eae miserae etiam ad parietem sunt fixae clavis ferreis; Ʋbi malos mores affigi nimis fuerat aequius,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore that <hi>God</hi> having already given us the best <hi>fundamental Laws,</hi> let us have <hi>good Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns,</hi> and we shall have <hi>good humane Laws,</hi> and let us have <hi>good Magistrates,</hi> and we shall have <hi>good exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> which is the end or use of Laws: But if we have <hi>bad Soveraigns,</hi> we shall have <hi>bad Laws,</hi> in part, and the <hi>good</hi> will be uneffectual; much more if also we have <hi>bad Magistrates.</hi> This is past doubt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 9. How a Common-wealth may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this Theocratical temper, if it have advantages, and the Rulers and People are willing.</head>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 210. AS it should be the desire of all good men, that the Common-wealth might be happy in the enjoyment of the Gospel and Peace, and this secured to posterity, so the open way to attain these ends, consisteth in these following Rules of practice.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. I.</hi> That the Ministers of Christ that are to teach and guide the people by the Word of God, be generally able, judicious, godly, faithful, diligent men.</p>
               <p>We cannot expect the people to be good, if the Teachers be bad, unable, or negligent. It is Gods Word that's managed by them, that must reform the people, and work out their vice. As mens Laws sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Laws of God, and mens Government presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth Gods Government; so the true methodical obedience to mens Laws, presupposeth obedience to Gods Laws, and consequently some understanding of them; and a right subjection to man presupposeth subjection to God. The first work therefore being the Ministers, the true reformation of the Ministry, making them indeed Divine, is the first thing to the making a Common-wealth Divine.</p>
               <p>Much hath been done already to this of late in this
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170314:164"/> Nation, through the blessing of God: (though much is yet to be done, especially for ripening the Ministry in Judgement and Charity, &amp; bringing them to neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Unity, which time must do.) And the principal hopes that we have in this Land of a faithful suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Election of Parliaments, from any thing that is yet before us, is the happy success of the Ministry upon the Souls of many, by which the people being much reformed (though yet too little) are more enclined to prudent pious men to be their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in Parliament, then they have been heretofore. So that this hath made a hopeful beginning, and if it be cartyed on, will do much more.</p>
               <p>This is not unknown to the Enemies of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to the Papists, that all conspire against the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, as knowing that to make them odious, and their labours vain, or get them down, is the likelyest way to attain their ends.</p>
               <p>Let these enemies note, that I am not here plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Lordly greatness, nor Riches to the Ministry, nor an aliene Power in State affairs, or any coercive Power at all: (and would they have a Clergie lower?) but only that they may be Learned, Judicious, Godly, Able, faithful men, provided with their daily bread, or food and rayment: And can they for shame oppose this?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 211. Rul. <hi>II.</hi> Above all let there be a fixed Law for the due Regulation of the Electours and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Parliaments.</q>
               <p>The true Reformation must here begin; and if the <hi>Foundation</hi> be well laid in the <hi>people,</hi> the building will be firm and safe.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:170314:164"/>
               <p>And here let me presume to speak a few words of the <hi>Necessity,</hi> and of the <hi>Ʋtility</hi> of this course, and then, <hi>How it should be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is known that Parliaments <hi>qua tales,</hi> are not Divine, Religious, Protestant or just. The six Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by which the Martyrs were burnt, were made by a Parliament. All the Laws for the Papal interest in the dayes of Popery have been made by them. They have often followed the wills of Princes to and fro. And therefore they are not indefectible, nor immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as such.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is known that there are Members of various minds in them all, and sometime the miscarrying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is so strong, that by a few more voices they might bring misery on the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is well known that in most p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, the Major Vote of the Vulgar that are Choosers are Ignorant, selfish, of private Spirits, ruled by mony; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their Land-lords, and other great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men; and withal they are bitterly distasted against the serious diligent practice of Religion, according to the Rules of Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is therefore apparent that if they had their Liberty, they would choose such as are of their minds; and it was by providence and accident that heretofore they did not so.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And it is certain, that the wars, the change of Church government and forms of worship, the differences of Religious men, and the many Sects that have lately risen up among us, and the strict Laws of Parliament about the Lords day, &amp;c. and specially their Taxes, have deeply discontented them and exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated them against such as they think have caused
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170314:165"/> these, so that many would now purposely design their ruin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is known that in the late Elections, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of Delinquents, and the Countenance of the times made terrible by many late successes against all sorts of enemies, and the present existence of the Army that hath so prevailed, hath been their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, so that they durst not go according to their inclinations.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is known that the restrained Gentry, with those that are enemies to serious holy living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Christian Rules, are in most places strongest in popular Interest; having most Tenants, and most of the affections of the vulgar: And that they can this day, were they but as free from fear of sufferings as others, bring more voyces into the field in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then any others can: And that even many well meaning honest men are of cowardly Spirits, and dare not displease their Landlords or great Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but will vote with the stronger side.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And its known that the Leaders never less want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all upon the grounds fore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>And what followeth upon all this, but either still to keep an Army over them (which should not be) or to Regulate the Election, is necessary to save us from ruine by a Parliament? For what probability is there but the next that is chosen by such a Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Votes with absolute freedom, will undo all that hath been done, and be revenged to the full on all that were so odious to them, and settle our calamity by Law? The effect lyeth so obvious to a discerning eye, (and almost to all) in the Moral Causes, that we may reckon it as done already, if not prevented.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:170314:165"/>2. But could a Prudent course be taken now for the Regulating of future Elections, we should have a moral security of good Parliaments to all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who would make good Laws, and see to the execution, and be under God, the sum of Blessings for the Common-good; We should have Parliaments of the wisest and most pious men; and such as are least for private Interest, but would devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God and to their Countrey; The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be the Princes Interest; so that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would nor could divide from them. And they would be the peoples Interest, so that they could not disown them, but would lift them up in their esteem, and set them with the first in their daily prayers and praises unto God. And Parliaments would be more Honourable, when they were more Divine, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen only by vertuous men, and not by prophane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched persons. In a word, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> were more likely to be secured to Posterity, certainly, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, and honestly this way then any way.</p>
               <p>And then the effecting of it will be an Actual most excellent Reformation of the Common-wealth it self; and the Regulating Laws, excluding the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, would engage the people against Vice, and so conduce to their salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 212. The Regulating Law must contain 1. the description of the Electors by their necessary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications; and 2. a course for Legal discerning the Qualified from the Ʋnqualified; and 3. a Regulation of the Manner of Elections.</q>
               <p>The first and second reform the very substance of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170314:166"/> the Republike, and are the most necessary excellent part of its Reformation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 213. 1. For the due Qualification of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, let so much of Gods own Laws be owned, as is still undoubtedly in force.</q>
               <p>It is an erroneous and impious assertion that all Gods Political Laws are repealed. <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Policy must be distinguished from <hi>Particular:</hi> And the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> from the Application of them to a particular people and case. As the world is still Gods universal Kingdom, so hath he univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Laws to Govern them. The fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment set in the Head of the second Table, is the summary or ground of humane Politicks, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties of Princes and people, though Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children only are expresly mentioned. The following Commands agaainst Murther, Adultery, Theft, and false witness, were part of the Jews Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Laws, and are still part of Gods Universal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, and belong to every Common-wealth in particular to enforce, and see them executed, as well as Ethically to private Consciences. Princes are the keepers of Gods Laws, and must see them executed; to promote which, their Laws must be Subservient: where any of these Morals by a penalty annexed is applyed to the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular, though <hi>quatenus Mosaica &amp; Judaica,</hi> the Law be ceased, yet as it is the Law of Nature, or as Christ hath taken it into his Law, it doth remain: And not only so, but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of many other Jewish Laws may still be significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Gods Will to us, and so be Obligatory.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:170314:166"/>
               <p>Where there is nothing in the difference of their state and ours that varieth the case so as to destroy to us the Reason of the Law, it may thus indirectly bind us still, by shewing us what God would have men in such a case to do.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 214. The Moral Qualification of Electors must be this, that no man choose but those that have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely owned the Baptismal Covenant, personally, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarely and seriously, taking the Lord for their only God, even the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Sanctifier; and that lyeth not under the guilt of any of those sins for which God would have men put to death, or cut off from his people.</q>
               <p>Here are but two things required in the Moral Qualification, which no man that hath the name and face of a Christian can except against. First, that he be one that owneth God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, in personal Covenant; that is, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess himself a Christian: Others are excluded from Liberty, I think, by our Laws already. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be denyed. That he was Baptized in <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is not enough, because choosing Parliament men is not a work for Infants, but the Adult; and he at age that owneth not his Baptismal Covenant, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, or at least is not to be reckoned among believers. The second point is, that he live not in such sins as God would have men cut off for. And who can except against this? But here note 1. That it is not the oft committing such sins only that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him uncapable; but being at that time <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Guilt;</hi> For a man must be hanged for <hi>one</hi> Murder,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170314:167"/> though he daily live not in it. 2. It is the <hi>Guilt in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro humano</hi> that I speak of, and not of his conscience as to God. If the Magistrate pardon him, and fully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, he is not under <hi>Guilt</hi> before him. 3. Note that it is not only cutting off by Death, but also by an extermination, or disfranchising, or excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I speak of. He is unfit for the Priviledge of a <hi>Chooser,</hi> that God would have any of these wayes to be cut off, but specially by Death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And note, that a capital offender may have pardon for his life, when yet the Ruler may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps restore him to his freedom herein.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 215. For what crimes God would have men cut off, I have shewed before, <hi>cap. 7. viz.</hi> For Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Idolatry, perswading to Idolatry, Murder, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealing, Incest, Sodomy, Adultery, presumptuous sinning, and obstinate refusing to obey Magistrate, Priest, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in case of Gluttony, Drunkenness, and the like: and all such as would not seek the Lord: all wizzards, and that turn after wizzards, and more such like, which may easily be collected.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 216. It will be a fair and expeditious course, that all these crimes enumerated by the Parliament, for which they allow Pastors to excommunicate men, shall also disable any person from choosing any Parliament-man or Magistrate.</q>
               <p>There are many enumerated in the Ordinance that setleth the Government of the Church, and if the Parliament please, they may add more, as they see cause.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:170314:167"/>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 217. At least it cannot be denied us, but that those crimes enumerated in the late Humble Petition and Advice, disabling men to sit in Parliament, should also disable the people to Elect.</q>
               <p>And that much well executed, would do the Nation very much right, and free us from much guilt and danger. And there is no Reason that Lords and Knights should be disabled, and Pesants let alone in their Priviledges that are guilty of the same things.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 218. As no man was to live a member of the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> that entered not into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, and submitted not to his worship, under the Ministration of the Priests (though they might have faults) but he that would not seek the Lord God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was to be put to death, be he great or small, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 11, 12, 13. So no man should be so free in our Common-wealth as to be choosers of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men or Magistrates, that live not in Christian Order and communion, for the ordinary worshipping of God, and under the Discipline or Guidance of some faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastors (where such are) either Approved or Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Magistrate.</q>
               <p>To be an ordinary despiser of Gods pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or a neglecter of it, and of the Guidance of Gods Ministers, was Death or cutting off in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish times: And no man can tell us why it should not be at least a cause of disfranchizing now. A man by disfranchizing is not a penny the poorer, but only kept from hurting the Common-wealth. And its a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170314:168"/> hard case, if we must commit our lives and Religion to the Votes or Government of them that God would have had then cut off, and put to Death! Let men have liberty freely in all lesser doubtful things that good and sober Christians differ about: and if they be Impious or Infidels, (unless by particular crimes they incur any penalty) I urge not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate now to deprive them of their Estates or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Liberties: But let them have nothing to do with Governing us. A man would think this should be a fair and moderate motion: It is not an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist, nor an Independent, nor any upon such kind of differences that I am motioning an exclusion of: But those that are <hi>Members</hi> of no <hi>Approved</hi> nor <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated</hi> Church. And there is great Reason. For 1. They Live like Atheists and Infidels, and therefore they may be numbred, if not with such, yet with them that are near them. Faith is practical, and tendeth to holy living and obeying. He that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to give God his publike Worship, and so denyeth him the chief part of his homage, is an Atheist in life. 2. There were no Christians in the Apostles dayes that had a fixed abode, that were not members of the Christian Churches in the places where they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and those that were unruly and walked disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, were to be avoided and cast out. 3. If they believe not that God is to be worshipped publikely by his servants, and would perswade others against all publike worship, they are not fit to live among men; therefore if they themselves forsake it, they are unfit for to meddle with our Government. 4 He is not ordinarily fit to choose a Governour, that as to his Morals is not capable of Governing (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170314:168"/> a gradual difference.) But the neglecters of all Church-order, and Communion, and Discipline, are unfit to Govern: for they would destroy Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the world: therefore they are unfit to choose. 5. If it be because they know not of a true Church to joyn with, its a sign they doubt of the Head when they doubt of the body, and know not that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is King, that know not his Kingdom: Or else are justly to be suspected for Romish Juglers, whose design is to take down all, that they may set up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 6. However it be, they that excommunicate themselves from Christian Churches, can blame none but themselves for it, and have no reason to expect to be taken for Rulers or choosers in a Christian Common-wealth. 7. He that refused all publike Worship under the Priests, would not have been judged to seek the Lord, nor be one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. 8. God hath no ordinary publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship but by his Ministers; and therefore to live under the Guidance of no Pastor, is to reject the stated way of worship; nor can he (ordinarily) be numbred with the flock of Christ, that is under no particular Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. Every one therefore should be a member of some Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 219. 2. For the execution of this Law, there should be careful provision, which being a Modal thing, I shall not presume to say so much of, but leave to the wisdom of Governours: only I see before us 1. an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect uneffectual way, which is by convicting men for these crimes before some Justice. 2. An effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular more excellent way, which is this: Let all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors in <hi>England</hi> that are approved have an Instrument
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170314:169"/> of Approbation, and all that are Tolerated an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Toleration; and let no man be a chooser or a Ruler that holdeth not communion with an Approved or Tolerated Church, and is not signified under the Pastors hand to be a member thereof: or that shall be cast out of the Church for any of those crimes that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall enumerate: And that there may be no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of Ministers usurpations or abuses herein, let every Parish have one or two of the wisest men by the superiour Rulers made Church-Justices, or Censors to meet with the Church-Officers, and to take cognizance of the cause: And let all that the Pastors and Church take in or cast out according to Gods Word, be used by them as members or no members of the Church; But let no man be disfranchised in the Common-wealth, or lose his Vote in Elections, unless the Censor or <hi>Church-Justice Ruled by the Parliaments Laws,</hi> consent to the censure. And let all that are cast out by <hi>his consent and the Churches both,</hi> be registred, and disabled to Vote, unless by the consent of both upon Repentance they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.</q>
               <p>This course is equal: For it is not meet that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters should be the disposers of the Liberties of the Common-wealth, nor will it help but hinder their Ministry that they should mix it with any secular Power; and though the penalty were but conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential, it would be inconvenient for them to use that Power. And yet on the other side, it is not Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Orders any further then as they are subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to Gods Laws, that they must Guide the Church by. Now in this way the disfranchized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath no more trouble through the Minister then
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170314:169"/> if he had nothing to do in it, but some more ease and benefit: For if the Censors alone should judge him criminous, he would have no benefit by the Churches more favourable Judgement, in case the Censors should be too rigid: Or if they should bear any man a Grudge, it is unmeet they should disable him alone: And therefore when the Judgement of the Church and of the Censors must concur to any mans Conviction, he will be further from the danger of any injury: The Church shall have no power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict him with Relation to his civil Liberty; but only the Censors shall not do it without their consent, that his Liberty may be the better secured.</p>
               <p>If you think that this power of Church and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors is too great to be exercised over Justices of Peace, or persons of greater place: I answer, 1. Where ever there are Justices of Peace, it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that they be themselves the Censors; and therefore that fear is vain: And for <hi>Riches,</hi> they should priviledge no man in impiety. 2. You may leave your Greater men (if you will be partial) to some higher Judgement, or leave them the Liberty of an Appeal.</p>
               <p>Of the Office of these Censors I shall speak more under the last Rule.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But what shall be done in the Tolerated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? Answ.</hi> As you please, either let them also cast out none from his Common-wealths Priviledges without the consent of the Censors of that Parish; or rather let them alone to do with their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as they list in this respect; Because 1. They will be so eager to keep their strength and number, that they will dispriviledge none of their own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170314:170"/> great cause. 2. And if they do, it is usually best of all; for it will drive them to the approved Churches.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But what if Ministers will not admit of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons into their Churches? shall they therefore want their civil Priviledges? Answ.</hi> 1. If Ministers grosly miscarry in their Office, the Magistrate hath power to punish them, or cast them out; and what would you have more? 2. If one Church will not receive them, another will, either Approved or Tolerated. 3. If all this will not serve, let your Censors in this also have the Judgement, or a Negative voyce. Let the Qualifications already given by the Parliament concerning those that are to be debarred from the Lords Supper for Ignorance or scandal, be the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Rule (with what else they think meet to add) and if any man publikely offer himself to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Approved Church of that Parish where he liveth, and be refused, if the Censor Judge the Refusal injurious (according to the Parliaments Rules) let it not injure him in his civil Liberties, but let him be Registred <hi>inter Cives;</hi> Though I think this caution should be unnecessary, because the Ministers themselves are under your Power. But it is only men that are utterly uncapable of Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or that wilfully refuse it, that we desire may be no <hi>Choosers</hi> or <hi>Cives</hi> (though <hi>Subjects</hi> still.)</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But what if your Pastors will neglect Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and let in the most scandalous men; will not the Common-wealth be polluted and hazarded by their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence? Answ.</hi> 1. It can be no worse for that, then it is; and therefore thats no reason against the thing. 2. I confess there lyeth the greatest danger; And therefore Parliaments should not by any causeless
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170314:170"/> jealousies of Ministers doing overmuch, restrain, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or discourage them from that duty which flesh and blood is most against of all their work; But let the wilful neglect of Discipline (and if you will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive rigour too) be punishable according to the quality of the offence. And let there be a Court of Commissioners in every County (those that are for ejecting scandalous Ministers) empowred thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; For <hi>Ejection</hi> should not be the punishment of smaller faults, especially before obstinacy; nor yet should such faults be unpnished; But of this more anon. But that here the Censor should have power alone to deprive him of his civil Liberty (as we grant him alone to preserve it) will be injurious to mens Rights.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 220. The third part of the Law for Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Elections, concerneth the Manner of Electing, where variety of tolerable Modes occurring, I shall not presume to extol any one above the rest, there being no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of any one Mode as the self-conceited Modellers imagine. 1. The <hi>Cives</hi> that are in the Censors Register may meet in every Parish Church, and before the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, Ministers, Constables, Church-Wardens, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers of the poor (sworn all to fidelity) may give their Votes for Parliament-men, which these Officers may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in at a General meeting to the High Sheriffe. 2. Or these <hi>Cives</hi> in the same place and manner, may choose their Deputies (proportioned to the number of the people in all Parishes) which Deputies may at the General meeting (to avoid confusion) choose the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men (being themselves first sworn to a faithful choyce) And these Elections in the Parishes, and the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170314:171"/> County meetings may be either by Vote or Ballot.</q>
               <p>The confusion that is now at Elections, is very great; and without abundance of cost to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey or the Elected Gentlemen, so great a multitude cannot be brought to the Pole; which if they be not, the uncapable rout may intrude and carry it. And therefore for every Parish or Hundred, either to send in their written Votes by Officers, or rather to send their sworn Deputies with power to Vote in their stead, will more orderly dispatch the work, and with much less charge and trouble. Every Deputy may bring in a list of the names which he representeth; and so he that representeth a Parish of an hundred men, shall have the voices of an hundred; and he or they that represent a Parish of a thousand men, shall have the voices of as many.</p>
               <p>Where there is danger lest the Greatness of any over awe the people from their liberties, the Ballot is somewhat the safer way then the open Vote; and yet not much; both because Juglers by slight of hand might convey in five for one; and specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those great men will beforehand be engaging the people to Promise them their suffrages, and they dare not deny the <hi>Promise,</hi> if they are such as dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them their <hi>Vote;</hi> And yet in all these things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, we would not stick to gratifie Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> or any rational Modeller, that can get the Parliaments consent. But 1. We must have our <hi>Cives,</hi> the matter of our Republick first reformed. 2. And we would have no more change then needs must, but things done with as little stir as may be, about circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and not have the <hi>Venetian</hi> painted dress and toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170314:171"/> gawds, to cover a defiled people; nor with a great deal of cost, and labour, and pomp, to set up an adorned Image; <hi>Et magno labore nugas agere, ut materiam superares opus.</hi> We are somewhat indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for the <hi>dress;</hi> but cannot be indifferent, whether we have a pious or impious, Christian or Infidel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

               <p n="1">1. The Law must describe them according to their necessary qualifications. 2. The choosers of them (especially where Parliaments choose) may be sworn
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170314:172"/> as near as they can to choose according to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. 3. Themselves are to be sworn to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 224. <hi>Rul. V.</hi> The Prudence and Piety of the Prince is of high concernment to the Happiness of the People; which is to be secured in Countries where he is Elective, by a duly Regulated Election; and where he is Hereditary, by a duly Regulated Education; and by due Limitations, and by Oath.</q>
               <p>Where he is <hi>Elective,</hi> a Description is presupposed as existent in Gods General Laws already, which must be observed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 225. The safe way for Election, is, that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament choosing or approving the Council, swear them to choose four of the best Qualified persons, and that a well regulated Lot take one of the four; the people of the chief City, or adjoyning parts, seeking God by solemn fasting and prayer, for merciful determination by that Lot.</q>
               <p>In elective Principalities, it must be supposed that a Council of State have a sufficient power to keep the Peace till a due Election: and yet that they be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently disabled from perpetuating <hi>their</hi> Supremacy, or delaying the Election.</p>
               <p>The Persons to be Elected may be either left to themselves as to their Rank, or they may be limited, either to take four of the Council (as men first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Parliament, and acquainted best with State affairs); or else the General of the Army (if
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170314:173"/> he be not of the Council) and one of the Nobility, and two of the Council. But however let them at their admission into Council, be strictly sworn to choose the fittest according to the described Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, if they shall be called to a choice.</p>
               <p>Here are divers things expressed as necessary, or much conducible to the propounded end. (Supposing still that we speak of those Nations that are setting up, or have already an Elective Prince, that is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, nor hath the whole Soveraignty, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with a Parliament or Senate) 1. That the Senate choose the Council, or at least approve of them. And so <hi>themselves</hi> being first composed as aforesaid, there will be great hopes of a Prudent Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Council.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Council</hi> (or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if then sitting) choose <hi>four,</hi> being swore to a faithful choice aforehand.</p>
               <p>And here let it be observed, that <hi>Election</hi> is to be preferred to a <hi>Lot,</hi> where it may be performed upon grounds of Judgement and Freedom, and that a <hi>Lot</hi> is not to be brought into use, but in cases of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, where judgement faileth. For, 1. Else men shall neglect the Law of God, which is propounded to them as the Rule of Judging. 2. And they shall neglect their Reason and Gods gifts, by which they are qualified for Judging. 3. And they will tempt God, and therefore provoke him to afflict them by the Lot, while they take his name in vain. 4. And if they elect not fit persons in preparation to the Lot, but turn loose a Lot among a number that are most unfit; they betray the Common-wealth to ruine. Is our new Modellers should carry their Lotteries among the vulgar rowt, whesr there's one or two
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170314:173"/> wise men among a multitude, and expect that their Lot should find out those few, thay might be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by experience, that God made them no promise of such success, nor appointed Lots to spare men the use of their Reason. Till I have Gods command or promise to shew for our encouragement, I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he that casts a Lot to find out one wise and godly man among an hundred simpletons or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, is likely an hundred to one to be deceived. The Apostles chose two of the meetest men, to be <hi>Judas</hi> his successor, before they made use of the Lot: and then the Lot did choose <hi>Matthiae</hi> one of the two.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is here taken for a matter of great necessity, that yet a Lot should finally determine. (In an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary case indeed, as after a Conquest, usually One only is capable: but we are not giving Rules for extraordinaries.) And the need of this Lot is thus apparent. 1. It will prevent Confederacies and making parties and friends for the succession, which else will hardly ever be prevented. 2. It will avoid the <hi>odium</hi> that else will lie upon the Council, from the rejected party: Men will easier take a rejection from God then from man. 3. It will prevent the dis-satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and consequent rebellious contrivances of the rejected. For it seemeth a dishonour to be rejected by <hi>choosers,</hi> but its no dishonour to miss it upon a Lot. 4. It is a most rational suitable course, that he that stands <hi>next God,</hi> should be <hi>chosen by God,</hi> and God should have the principal hand in the choice. The Apostles gave God the choice of <hi>Matthias an Apostle</hi> by Lot, because no power under God was fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey (or choose a man to) the highest Ecclesiastick
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170314:174"/> power: But they chose not <hi>inferiour</hi> Officers by Lot. 5. It will more comfortably satisfie <hi>the Prince,</hi> to do or suffer in his office, when God calls him to it. 6. It will very much satisfie the people in their submission and obedience, and prevent rebellions, and hinder suspitions of the Princes ambitious aspiring to the power.

               <p n="4">4. It is here taken also as necessary, that the Lot be carefully regulated by a Law, <hi>e. g.</hi> as to be done before many, in the publickest Church of the City, in such and such order, which is easily contrived; that so they that would creep in by unrighteous means may have no hope.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the chief City or all that are near, that can so speedily meet, may by fasting and prayer seek Gods merciful determination, is a thing of apparent need, by reason of the great weight of the case, and that the Government may be more purely Divine, and the people the fullyer satisfied in the person, and the blessing of God procured thereby.</p>

               <p>The Prince that will not Consent to this, for fear of losing his Interest in his own children, in reason should not desire that they should hereditarily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>succeed

If he do govern for the common good, then the Common-wealth hath a far greater Interest in his children that must succeed, then he can have. If they be so his own, as to be principally for <hi>him,</hi> or for <hi>themselves,</hi> they are then unfit to be the Governours of a Common-wealth.

               <p>The Reason of this is, 1. Because of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all Princes (as of all men) who therefore must be supposed to have some evil or imprudence, whose evil fruits should be prevented, that they may not produce the common hurt. 2.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170314:175"/> Arming the freemen: men of best Education and Interest, will be most valiant and most trusty; and if Reformed as I forementioned, they will be truest to their Country, in matters of everlasting consequence: It is reason that men of greatest Interest and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency should be trusted with the defence of themselves and their own. The cowardliness of Freeholders is the undoing of their Country: To save their own skin they arm their servants, and so make them their Lords. Especially when it comes to fighting indeed, and they dare not venture their lives: Or else in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Wars, where they use to employ their servants only, except in command, and then they return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as their Conquerers. Many that are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may be sent abroad, but not so many as may be able to master their Commanders, and the junior sort of Freemen, that should still be mixt in competent numbers. The most servile and base are usually through the disadvantage of their education the most impious. And so much wickedness as usually dwelleth in such Armies, is worse then the enemy to them. None of the Forces in pay, that intend the common good, and deserve the name of Christians, or Common-wealths-men, will be unwilling to have the faithful people of the Land to be possessed of a strength sufficient to ballance them for their necessary preservation.</p>
               <p>The rest also are so plainly rational, necessary and conscionable, that I shall think it needless to give Reasons for them distinctly, there being nothing but ignorance, ungodliness, or a treacherous selfish design to master the Common-wealth, that can have any thing considerable to say against them.</p>

That every Regiment of Foot have one faithful Minister to teach them, and every Regiment of Horse two at least (because quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering very distant, one man can be but with few at once.) Seducers are the seditions disturbers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers, who will creep in and prevail, if there be none to gain-say them.</p>

               <p>It is a great mistake in many Law-makers, that are more solicitous incomparably to restrain both Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Magistrates and Ministers from going too far, and doing too much, then to put them on to do that which is indeed the business of their Office, when yet flesh and blood will do as much (and in the Ministry abundance more) to bring us to the <hi>defective</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, then to the excessive.

               <p>God hath in wonderful Holy Wisdom so nearly joyned the Church and Commonwealth, and the Magistracy and Ministry, that both are of necessity to the welfare of each Nation; and it hath occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many ignorant men to contend about their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,

Some must have a Pope to carry both swords, and trample upon Kings and Common-wealths; or at least they must have Lord Bishops to set and Vote among the Lords: And others must think them unworthy to speak in the Cause of Christ, which sometime is tost up and down by men that little understand it; and some think them not worthy to stand in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but make them as the scum and scorn of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: And what have they but their holy Relation to Christ and his service, to make them so contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible?

For their studies, unless it be Divine things that make men fools, or much learning and studie that make them less wise then other men, and unless the way to wisdom be to lay asleep our Reason, and cast off study, or at least to study no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher then the Moon, undoubtedly they have the advantage by far of any one rank of men.

Magistrates and Ministers therefore must joyn together in the work of God: yet so that we will not meddle at all with their work; much less desire their Riches and honour: Let them take the Pomp, and Rule, and wealth of the world: We desire them so much splendor as may countenance them in their work.

To free the Magistrate from all jealousie of our usurpations, and to further us in our work, by an holy Concord, Let every Parish have one or more Censors, or Civil Officers, enabled to these following works. 1. To keep peace in the Congregations, if any make disturbance, or if any by force intrude to the Sacrament (for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors or people have no power of violence.) 2. To joyn with the Minister and Church-Wardens in disposing of Seats in the Church, to avoid Contentions. 3. To meet once a moneth with the Church-Officers (or others) to hear the Causes that are brought before them: Where, 1. He may force those to appear as Magistrate, (when he sees cause) whom we can but intreat. 2. And he may (when he sees cause) have power to administer an oath. 3. And his Power and Vote concurring or dissenting, may determine how far the Magistrate shall second them; And also, 4. That none be taken to be disfranchised for
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170314:179"/> crimes, by any excommunication, without the Censors conviction and consent (as we said before.)</q>
               <p>In every Corporation that hath a Maior or Bayliff, and other Justices, let them also be the Censors. And in small Countrey Parishes where no Justice of Peace abideth, let the sufficientest person or persons be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Magistrate to this Office: And let him have no further Power. If the Church may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the fittest persons, and the Rulers accept or reject them as they see cause, and so authorize such as they accept, it may fully satisfie their interest. If they refuse this, we are well content that they choose them as they see meet. This will further the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and stop the Erastians mouthes, and take away the jealousies that are usually by Magistrates kept up against the Pastors: Their Censors shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and see whether we meddle with State matters, or go beyond our line. But still let this introduce no confusion of the Offices by the conjunction. Let the Churches acts be valid to meer Church respects (as Absolution or Excommunication) whether the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors shall consent or not: but let them be of no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon Civil Rights, if he consent not. As Magistrates are Civil Rulers of Pastors and Churches, and must help them with their power against obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate untractable ones; so there is no reason that we should desire them to be meerly the Executioners of our Sentence; but they must take cognizance of the cause, and Judge where they must execute: If therefore their Officers be with us, and have notice of the whole proceeding, they may be satisfied how far to own our acts.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 236. Though Magistrates cannot force men to Believe, Love God, and so to be saved, yet they must force them to submit to holy Doctrine, and learn the Word of God, and to walk orderly and quietly in that condition, till they are brought to a voluntary personal profession of Christianity, and subjection to Christ and his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and so being voluntarily Baptized, (if they are new converted Heathens, that never were before bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) or Confirmed (if they were baptized before) they may live in holy Communion with the Church.</q>
               <p>If Magistrates force not, or Ministers cause not the grosly ignorant to hear and learn, and submit to Conference, or Catechizing, and such necessary means of Instruction till they are confirmed, or by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Pastors admitted into the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church with the adult, their Infant-Baptism will but let in corruption and confusion into the Churches, while men are commonly taken for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, that know not what Christianity is, or live in the open violation of their Baptismal Covenant. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters therefore should be by Law restrained from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the uncatechized and unconfirmed to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>

The Ʋnity also of the Church is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful to the safety and peace of the Common-wealth, that Parties be not hatched and animated against each other, who will be disturbing the Common peace to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ends.</q>
               <p>Two extreams are here to be avoided. The first of them, that will give Liberty or Forbearance to none
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170314:180"/> but those of one opinion or way, in points where dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is tolerable. And while they think by this to secure Unity and Peace, they most effectually destroy them both: while they put a necessity on many good and sober men, to suffer the execution of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and then move compassion in others to the sufferers, and provoke many to hazard all for their impunity. The other extream is theirs that either purposely cherish divisions to weaken the people, that they themselves may hold the ballance, and make advantage of their dissentions, or at least do careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permit intolerable Heresie, infidelity or impiety to be propagated or practised without due restraint. And these Rulers will find in the issue, that obeying God, and looking to his Interest, and the common good in greatest things, was their greatest duty, and would have most conduced to their own security: and that when these Factions have a while contended with each other, some of them will fall on the Magistrate himself, and however he behave himself, he shall never be without some perilous enemies. A broken, divided, contending people will never be long true to him, nor strong enough to defend him: but their strength is most exercised in winceing at each other, till perhaps they have unhorst the rider.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 238. The means which the Magistrate must use for the Churches unity, are these. 1. He must neither himself impose, nor suffer the Pastors to impose any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain or unnecessary points of doctrine, discipline or worship, as necessary to the Ʋnion or Communion of Churches, but restore the primitive simplicity; by take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures in general as the sufficient Rule
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170314:181"/> and Law of faith and worship, and the antient Creeds of the Church in particular, as the universal Symbole: or if any more copious be drawn up, let it meddle with no Controversies that may be forborn, and let it be as much as may be in Scripture words.</q>
               <p>Necessary points must be held as necessary; and unnecessary things must not be made necessary. This is the great Engine that hath torn the Churches and battered their Peace. If men <hi>Zealous</hi> for <hi>opinions</hi> cry out against errours, and for security of the Orthodox profession, let them have leave to be as Orthodox as they will, and to do as much against errour as they can: but let them not be the common Judges of Truth, nor have every thing done that fansie or fury shall think necessary to secure the Truth. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is acknowledged to be certainly true by us all; and therefore none will scruple the subscribing it; but so are not the doubtful collections of all that think their opinions must needs be Articles of their neighbours Creed. He is Orthodox that holds but so much Truth as is contained in the Scripture. He that believeth explicitly, and obeyeth but so much as is there delivered in plain expressions, is fit to be a Minister, and to have Communion with the Churches. He that subscribeth to the Truths which are <hi>plainly</hi> expressed in Scripture, and yet perverteth them by Heresie, or understandeth them not through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, may as easily pervert or not understand the same truths <hi>plainly</hi> delivered by men. Let therefore the holy Scripture be the National Confession and Religion: and let the antient <hi>Creeds</hi> be expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170314:181"/> by all that are Baptized, or admitted to Church-Communion. And if any special occasion make more seem necessary, which must be imposed, let that <hi>more</hi> be no <hi>more</hi> but a Confession expressed in Scripture-phrase, at least in every controvertible point which godly men do differ about. Let men enlarge their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Confessions, and spare not; but not impose them, nor make them the ballance of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>If any say that <hi>[It is meet that Pastors explicitly understand more then the antient Creeds, though no more may be of necessity to every member: and therefore a more large Confession is to be subscribed or owned, seeing by subscribing to the Scriptures, he professeth but an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit belief as to the particular truths.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, 1. I can as truly and wisely say that by subscribing to the National Confession he professeth but an Implicit belief of the particular truths therein contained. They are as plain and as well exprest in the Scripture as in the Confession. And therefore the subscribing of one is as good a proof of an Explicit belief, as of the other. 2. You know that subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to your Confession proveth not that men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. And therefore you take another course to try the sound understanding of the Preacher: It is supposed that he is a known tryed man, and that the Examiners have questioned him in order to discover his understanding, besides what his preaching must discover. And cannot the Examiners as well try him by a Question about some Scripture Text, as by a Question about an Article of a Confession that no more plainly containeth the same truth? 3. And then if he contradict the necessary Scripture-truths, which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170314:182"/> he doth confess; Church-Discipline and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, according to the quality of the Errour and offence, must restrain him; which they may as well do, if the Scripture only be the Rule, as if it be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 239. 2. It is necessary both to the purity and peace of the Churches, that the publishing or propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Certain intolerable Errours be restrained, both by the Magistrate and the Churches: and also the practice of <hi>such</hi> Errours that are practicable.</q>
               <p>As Liberty in things where Liberty may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is necessary to the Churches peace; so is restraint in things intolerable.

It is necessary to the Churches <hi>Peace,</hi> that no private Congregations be gathered, or Anti-churches erected by any but such as have an Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Toleration for it from the Magistrate: supposing still that such private Assemblies are Allowed of course
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170314:182"/> as are kept by the Approbation of Approved Ministers, in a due subordination to the Church-Assemblies.</q>
               <p>Let Approved or Tolerated Ministers (that have an Instrument of Approbation or Toleration) have leave to allow of private meetings, subordinate to the publike, so they be well regulated by Laws. But if unlimitedly private Assemblies be permitted, then 1. It is in vain to limit Toleration; for all will be Tolerated. 2. And then it will be impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain Heresie, Infidelity or impiety. 3. Yea they may meet to plot against the Magistrate, and who can discover or hinder them? To force them to keep open their doors is some Remedy, but a poor one: for they can do it at such times as none will trouble them. What honest man will be with them on the Lords Day at the time of publike Worship, or in the night unseasonably? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they can tell when any more then their own company are there. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families must be encouraged in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-worship, and honest Neighbours in helping each other in holy Exercises in their proper places. But no Assemblies should be Allowed by the Magistrate, but what an Approved or a Tolerated Pastor will Over-see and take care of, and in some sort be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for, as under his charge.</p>

It is necessary to the Churches Peace, that no Pastors or Christians be suffered in Print or Speech to rail at one another, and use contentious oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious speeches: but that the Magistrate moderate them in their Disputes, and that the Tolerated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be not suffered to cast scorn upon the Approved
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170314:183"/> Churches, nor to be over-busie or publike in drawing away others to their mind, supposing them to have leave to worship God themselves in their Tolerated way, and modestly to defend themselves under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates moderation.</q>
               <p>If other men for foul words shall be bound to the good behaviour, and scolding Women shall be put in the gumble stool: there is no reason that the people shall have leave to rail and scold on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their Opinions in Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In publike Disputes the Magistrate should be Moderator in point of peaceable modest carriage. And therefore he should be present in Synods usually to keep peace. No Synods have been so peaceably managed since the Magistrate withdrew from them, as they were before when he bore sway.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is supposed that the Magistrate judgeth the <hi>Tolerated</hi> Churches to be <hi>erroneous,</hi> though he judge them <hi>tolerable;</hi> and therefore it is not fit that he give them leave to draw people to their way by busie publike importunity, which may both corrupt and disquiet the Churches; nor to pour out contempt and scorn upon the Approved Ministers or Churches. But 1. They may have leave in their own Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies soberly and modestly to plead their own cause. 2. And also to defend it modestly in print, if it be assaulted. 3. And also to give to the Magistrate or others an account of their faith and worship when they are justly called to it. 4. And also to manage publike Disputes when the Magistrate shall License them.</p>

The Magistrate in order to the Churches peace must moderate Controversies, especially as managed by Writings and Disputes: and when he seeth that they are not used to Edification, but to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that they cannot be further suffered without the great danger of the Church, he must either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them silence, or prescribe them necessary bounds.</q>
               <p>The Servants of the Lord must not strive: and therefore Logomachies and perverse disputings that gender strife, and quench Charity, especially when they kindle a publick flame, are not to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Magistrates must not here <hi>unnecessarily</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: but when it is necessary, they must use their Authority, especially in over-seeing the press, and restraining passionate intemperate men.</p>

               <p>I speak not of Associations of parties to bandy against each other, nor of Synods directly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for Government of the particular Pastors: for this is controverted among wise men, whether they have such a Power. But as Scripture and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture require <hi>Ʋnity</hi> and <hi>Communion of Churches,</hi> and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170314:184"/>
                  <hi>concord in Gods Work,</hi> so do they require the means that Nature it self maketh necessary to these ends: But of this elswhere.</p>
               <p>Dividers therefore that refuse Communion with the Approved Churches, should have less of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates Countenance; and the Unanimous, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably peaceable men, that are Lovers of concord and brotherly communion, should from the Magistrate have some special countenance and encouragement.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 244. 7. The Magistrate must not commit any of his proper coërcive power into the Pastors hands, nor trust them with his Sword, either to depose each other, or any way Govern each other by force: But the reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others from their communion, and perswading men to avoid them, is all that the highest pretenders can call an Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over their Brethren, in which also they are to be moderated by the Magistrate for peace.</q>
               <p>It would long ago have quieted the Churches, if the Magistrates had kept their Power to themselves, and also had not made themselves the Prelates Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners. If the Pope had not got the Sword into his hand, nor into the hands of his Prelates, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates made not themselves his Lictors, he could not so much disturb the peace. If his Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were not seconded by violence, and he could not meddle with mens bodies or estates, he would be at last aweary of thundering against them that care not for it. And no Prelate hath any face of a Title to a forcing Power: who made them Magistrates! What they can do, must be by the Word upon the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170314:184"/> Conscience; by spiritual, and not by carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. And for a Magistrate to punish or destroy a man <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because he is excommunicate, before he knows whether it be just or unjust, is but to make himself the Prelates Hangman, and renounce his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with his Authority, and to do he knows not what or why, at the command of another; who yet cannot save him from the wrath of God if he prove a persecutor. As scolds in the street endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger not the Peace of the Land, because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and go to it but with Tongues, or Nails and Fists: so if Divines be kept unarmed, and have no power to persecute one another, they will at last be weary of contending, and when the fray is over, they will be as they were: Or if they passionately excommunicate each other, experience will convince them of their folly, and drive them to return to Unity, when they have felt a while that they are but weakened by it, and hindred in their work, and made the contempt and scorn of their enemies. But if a Prelate, or a Synod, or any of them have power to displace and cast out, or fine, or imprison, or banish others when they are angry with them, there will be no peace.</p>
               <p>Be awakened then, ye Christian Magistrates, to keep your Sword in your own hand, and use it for God, according to his Law, discerned by your own understandings (though taught by Ministers) and put an end to the quarrels of Popes, and Prelates, and Councils, that are partly contending <hi>for your power to be in them;</hi> and partly disturbing and destroying our peace by <hi>your Sword</hi> which they have got into their hands, or at their Commands.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:170314:185"/>
               <p>So much for the Rules by which a Common-wealth may be made a Theocrasie, or truly Divine, and the Kingdom of Christ may come among us, and his Will be done to the Glory of God and happiness of the people: Which I have, though not wholly, yet chiefly fitted to this Common-wealth, out of a desire of its felicity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 10. Of the Soveraigns Power over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the Church, and of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their Offices.</head>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 245. THE office of Magistrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (or Pastors of the Church) are <hi>totâ specie</hi> distinct.</q>
               <p>There are common actions that either of them may do: but they are distinctly obliged and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to special works, which are therefore proper to their several Offices: and forbidden to usurp each others office. <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> the King was smitten with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie for medling with the works of Priests.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 246. The Civil power is Essential to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth (or Civil Polity) and the Pastors only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to its well-being; and the Pastors are essential to the Church (as a Political Society) and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate necessary but to its well-being.</q>
               <p>A Church may possibly be without a Magistrate, but not well: And a Common-wealth may possibly be without the Pastors of the Church or other Ministers of Christ; but not well.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 247. Magistracy and Ministry are each of them Immediately and co-ordinately from Christ, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170314:186"/> neither of them from each other. Though respectively one may be under the other in exercise, as the Object to the Agent, yet neither of them flow essentially from the other, as the effect from its proper cause.</q>
               <p>Magistrates are not the Institutors of the Ministry: They set them not up, nor can take them down: Christ hath not put the Ministerial Power into the Magistrates hands as a conveying Cause, that they might give it Ministers. Nor do Ministers give the Prince his Power, though they have been used oft to Crown them. They are twisted together, and joyned as the Soul and Body, or rather as the Brain and Heart, the Intellect and Will, as I said before: but one is not the others root.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 248. Because the Power that is <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> in Christ, who is perfectly capable of it, cannot in the derived measure, be all received and exercised by one man; therefore he hath divided it, giving part to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and part to the Pastors, to be respectively exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised under him.</q>
               <p>It is a great Question with many, Whether the same man may be a Magistrate and a Minister? and a greater, Whether one man may be a Soveraign or the highest in both Powers in a Nation? And yet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Whether one man may be the Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Head of the whole world?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Papists commonly think, and so did our Prelates, that inferiour Magistracy may be ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held by a Bishop, and a Bishoprick by a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. Necessity I doubt not may make it lawful, to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170314:186"/> which all Laws of meer Order do very much submit. If there were no man capable of the Ministry there but the Magistrate, or no man capable of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie but the Minister, no doubt but they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the respective Offices conjunctly, rather then the Church or Common-wealth should be ruined, or receive any hazardous detriment. This I stand not to prove, as supposing the Evidence obvious to the Reader. But without such necessity, it seems to me they may not be conjoyned. For 1. Christ hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separated them. 2. Yea and forbid temporal Rule to his Ministers. 3. And he hath prescribed to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and Minister so much work as will take up the whole man and time. 4. And he hath forbidden Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to entangle themselves with the affairs of this life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. And 5. the antient Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally was of this mind, as is well known, not only by <hi>Can. Apostol.</hi> 6. 81, 83. but by the <hi>Council of Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Can.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. and divers others. <hi>Synesius Epist. Cont. Andronicum, &amp; Athanas. ad vitam solitar. agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> write expresly against it, and say that God hath separated the Offices, and that its not lawful for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to play the Magistrate, nor for Magistrates to play the Bishop. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is branded by <hi>Socrates</hi> with a black Mark, as being the first Bishop there that did usurp a coërcive power. What Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> saith against it, you may read in <hi>Grotius de Imperio sum. Pol. p.</hi> 37. He that will do one of the works faithfully, I warrant him will have no mind to have another Office to answer for, unless necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, which is nothing to the ordinary case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the second Question, I deny the subject of it on one part: There is not to be a Soveraign Pastor
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170314:187"/> in a Nation, as there is a Soveraign Prince. If there were, and one man could manage both, I confess Reason would say much for the great convenience that both should be in one hand. But we must not use our Reason to tell Christ what he should have instituted, but to find out what he hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And for the third, there is no need of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (but where pride and faction makes men mad) to prove that no meer man is capable of an universal Episcopacy, or an universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; much less of both; which yet the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of the Pope would give him. If Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> so abhorred the name of universal Patriarck in <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> how are they to be thought of that not only usurp both Name and Office, but also make it Essential to the Catholick Church, and necessarily to be believed to salvation? O horrid pride and faction! saith <hi>Gregory,</hi> Epist. Jon. Constant. c. 82. p. 208. [Tu quid Christo, Universalis scilicet Ecclesiae capiti, in extremi judicii es dicturus examine, qui cuncta ejus membra tibimet conaris Universalis appellatione supponere?

What need we any other testimony to prove the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of Popery? And how will the Pope any better answer it to Christ the true Universal Head, then the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> could do?
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170314:187"/> But I have said more to these men in due place.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 249. Magistrates and Pastors having diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of Power, must exercise their several Powers on one another: So that the Magistrate is the Pastori Ruler by the sword, and the Pastor is the Magistrates Pastor and Ruler by the Word.</q>
               <p>This is unquestioned among all sober Christians: save that the Papists put in some excepions for the exemption of their Clergy. There is no prudent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate that dare or will deny, that Pastors Authoritatively exercise their Office towards him, as well as towards other men. To exempt them from the Pastoral Power, is but to except them from their care and charge, and so from the benefits of their work: which is no greater a favour then to be exempted from all other helps from God by man: Was it <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> servitude to be taught by <hi>Aristotle?</hi> Would not that flatterer be kickt out of doors by a Prince, that should perswade him not to Obey his Physitians for his bodily health and life, as if it were a debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Majesty? Or that should perswade him not to let his Son be Guided by School-masters and Tutors?</p>
               <p>The Government of Pastors is much like a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Government of his Patients, especially in Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, or Cities where Physitians know their charge: Though a man be authorized by the Prince to be a Physitian, it is but unto voluntary Patients: every man may choose whether he will take their medicines or not. If the greatest Prince or the poorest man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it his Liberty, to die or be sick, rather then to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170314:188"/> submit to the Rule of a Physitian, they may use that Liberty. If they refuse to obey the Physitian, his Punishment is to deny them his help, and let them take their course. If God have inrrusted Pastors as his Officers, with a pardon to be by them delivered to the Penitent, and sealed by Baptism or the Lords Supper, or published by Absolution from particular sins, it is not in the power of any Prince here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose and force the Pastors to deliver this pardon or the seals to whom he please; or to the Impenitent, contrary to the will o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Christ. We must be faithful dispensers of the Messages, Pardon, Seals, and all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances committed to our trust. Nor will I at the command of a Prince, be the Pastor of a Church that will have Church priviledges, and refuse Church-Discipline. If the Prince himself will have me to be his Physitian, and yet will Rule himself, and refuse my directions, and command me to gve him my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that he may take it how and when he list him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I will disobey him, (if the Medicine mis-used be dangerous) lest I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And as long as he is free, whether he will use me as his Physitian or not, it is no injury to his Dignity, that I require him to submit to my direction, upon the penalty of being without my help. I need not tell you of <hi>Ambrose</hi> his usage of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> or <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> freedom with <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> and his resolution rather to lose his hand, then give the Sacrament to the proud contemners of God and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline: the nature of the office may satisfie any; he that hath said <hi>[A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second admonition reject]</hi> and <hi>[put away from

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 250. The nature of Pastoral Government, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over Magistrates or the meanest men, is not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial, Magisterial, Coercive by any force on body or estate, but like that of a Tutor over his Pupils, or a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian over his Patients, but that it is of a more especial Institution of Christ, and exercised by his Commission, and in his name.</q>

His jurisdiction is no other but this managing of the Keyes of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Excommunication and Absolution are but the Application of the Law of Christ to the persons and cases before us. But yet a Message from the Eternal God hath so much authority on the well-informed soul, that it can prevail without a rod or sword.

               <p>It is God that hath Instituted both the Offices, and therefore neither of them can change his Institutions; not wrong the Office of each other, by any depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 252. The several Powers of Magistrates and Ministers toward the persons of each other are limited, and neither of them are left to their absolute wills.</q>
               <p>It is not enough for a Minister to say, The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed to me, and therefore I may use them as I please: For he that did commit them to him, did also leave him a Law to use them by. And so is with the Magistrate.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 253. A faithfull Minister must be no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, but reprove a Prince as closely as another man: yet so that he be sufficiently tender of his honour, which is necessary to the ends of Magistracy.</q>
               <p n="1">1. How plainly by Gods own Command the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets dealt with Princes of old, and the Apostles with all men, and the ancient holy Bishops with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, is a thing so well known as needs no proof. If Princes sins be greatest, and their souls as precious as other mens, and their sins as dangerous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170314:189"/> and much more to the Commonwealth then others, there is then great reason why they should be as closely and faithfully dealt with. And he that meets with the reward of a <hi>Zechariah</hi> or <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, is as true a Martyr, and may as comfortably give up his soul to Christ, as he that dyeth in defence of an Article of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Honour of Magistrates must be tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded by the Reprover; and therefore his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof should be in secret, till meer necessity call it out into publike audience. Not out of fear, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: but 1. The honour of God is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Magistrates honour, for his Office-sake. If they should not too harshly uncover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Ministers, no more should Ministers do theirs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Magistrate be once under dishonour, he will be less capable of serving God, and managing his calling for the Common good, because of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. It is therefore necessary to the Common good, that the Magistrates honour be preserved. But if he openly offend, and own it, and openly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Reprover, and leave himself uncapable of more secret Reproofs, he may be openly Reproved, so it be with that submission and modesty that may signifie that we Honour him as a Magistrate, while we reprove him as an impenitent offender.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 254. Whether it be in case of Heresie or other crimes, both Magistrates and Pastors are Judges; but differently, as to different ends: The Magistrate is Judge who is to be corporally punished for Heresie or any crime, and this no Pastor must usurp: The Pastors are Judges Directive, who is to be excommunicated for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170314:190"/> Heresie or other crimes, or <hi>Absolved</hi> upon Repentance: and this no Magistrate may usurp.</q>
               <p>It is therefore an insipid Question of the Papists and Libertines, <hi>Who made the Magistrate Judge of Heresie?</hi> Or, <hi>Who sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o belongeth to: And there is a <hi>Judgement</hi> about <hi>Church-communion and Priviledges;</hi> and this belongs to them to whom it belongeth to admit to, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from that Communion and these Priviledges; which is not a Pope or distant Metropolitane or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesane, but the present Pastors of the Church, the People also having a Judgement of discretion, so far as is necessary to their own part in the Execution, and no more.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 255. Though a Magistrate may be an object capable of Excommunication; yet as it is not rashly to be done on the lowest, so it rarely fals out that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign may lawfully be excomunicate; because by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident it becomes unmeet.</q>
               <p>For instance: 1. It seldom if ever fals out, but that an Excommunication of a Soveraign will so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him, as to make against the Common-good, by making him less capable of improving his Office. 2. And it seldom fals out but that it will provoke the Magistrate to persecute not only a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170314:190"/> but all the Church that shunneth his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. And it seldom fals out that the Prince is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> member of that particular Church that moveth the doubt. 4. It is an hundred to one that the Church may as securely for their own Consciences, silently withdraw themselves from the Communion of such a Prince, without any Publication of an Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his dishonour. All this considered, and withall that Affirmatives bind not <hi>ad semper;</hi> and that Positives give place to greater duties, and by weighty Accidents may be suspended (as Christ shews, in the case of the Sabbath and eating the shew-bread) I think it will follow, that seldom, if ever, doth it fall out, but that by Accident, it will be unlawful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunicate the Soveraign, though Church-power simply extend to him as well as others.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 256. If a Magistrate of higher or lower rank be excommunicate, he must for all that be Honoured and obeyed, and no man is warranted thereby to contemn him.</q>
               <p>Much less may men lay hands on him, or dispossess him of his Dominions, as the Pope doth by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, or allow the Subjects to rebell, or to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him. Wonderful! that Princes will so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that Power, that not only teacheth this, but hath so often executed it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 257. To deny Magistrates to be the Objects of Pastoral Power, is but to deprive them of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mercies of the Gospel and Sacraments, and Church-communion, and order, and Absolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Christ hath committed into his Ministers hands, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170314:191"/> which Princes need as much as others, and have as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Ministerial Power is but an Obligation and Authority to administer these mercies in the name of Christ: and therefore the first Question is, <hi>Whether Magistrates have Right to the Blessings or not?</hi> If they have not, they are the most miserable: If they have, they must be so far under the Power of him that doth administer them, as the ends and application doth require. As if the Turk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so for Communion in the Lords Supper, and Absolution, and the rest.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 258 Magistrates may not usurp the Pastoral office, nor do the works that are proper to it.</q>
               <p>Such are the Administration of Sacraments and other publick Worship, and all contained in the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven: The Example of <hi>Saul, Ʋzza,</hi> and many Scripture passages are plain in this.

               <p>O fearful, doleful state of the Papal Nations! when among them, yea even in <hi>France,</hi> the Power of Princes over the Clergy, and the duty of Pastors to obey the Prince in secular things was so unknown, as that so wise a man must begin with a [forte aut non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum meminit quisquam]—</p>
               <p>It is one of the intolerable usurpations of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170314:192"/> Clergy, to plead an exemption for such a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous potent party, from municipal Laws and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Judgement: Though Christ paid Tribute, and commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to do the like: and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> have given such express commands to all the Church without exception, yea to every soul, to be subject to the Highers Powers, to honour them, to pay them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all this is nothing to men that have got the mastery of Gods Laws. Is it possible that they that plead Antiquity and Tradition for their Religion, can believe that they have either of them for this? Were the ancient Bishops exempt from the Judgement of the Magistrates, though Heathens? Or did ever any of them plead for such exemption? Nay, do they not with one consent profess the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Doth not Scripture and all Antiquity speak as plain for the Magistrates power over Bishops (that is, the Pastors of the Churches) and for the Churches subjection to Magistrates, as its possible for words to express? And yet these Novelists traiterously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend exemption. Persecution by unrighteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed the ancient Christians did deprecate and declaim against: but never against Magistrates judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Clergy. They did indeed condemn those Christians that were so worldly, uncharitable, and contentious, as to go to Law about personal inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which Christ had commanded them to forgive, and about the trifles of this world, when they all believed an everlasting glory: especially seeing they were Infidels that must be their Judges, who were their common enemies and persecutors! They made several Canons to restrain them from such unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courses, requiring them to avoid such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170314:192"/> to refer the matter to some among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And so the Bishop became by their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consent, instead of the Magistrate to them: but this was as well to the <hi>People</hi> as the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church: And when Magistrates turned Christians, the Churches kept their custom; and hence the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists would plead exemption from the Laws. It is still desirable that those that live in holy Communion, should forbear Law-suits about personal matters, while a reference to sober pious Neighbours may decide the difference, and prevent the uncharitable and costly consequents. But what? Shall we hence conclude that Christians are not subject to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate? Yea, even to a Christian Magistrate that is a shelter and a Nursing Father to us?

               <p>For Magistrates are the guardians of the Church, and must see to the execution of Gods Laws by all their Subjects in their places: And therefore Gods Laws were first given to the Prince and Priest, and by them to the people, as <hi>Isychius</hi> saith, in <hi>Levit. 15. pag.</hi> 329.

               <p>If a Pastor preach false Doctrine, the Magistrate
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170314:194"/> cannot therefore forbid him preaching, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue him a Pastor: and if he misadminister Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or any holy Worship, the Magistrate may not forbid him the administration of those Ordinances, and yet allow him the rest of his Office: and if he abuse his power about Church-censures, he cannot take Church-Government from him, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue him in the free exercise of other parts of the Ministry; for this is to abuse and alter the Office: Nor is it necessary that the Magistrate form him a Law of his own by which to exercise his Ministry; But the Magistrate must first rebuke those that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, and then punish them if they amend not, and cast them out, in cases that make them more <hi>hurtful</hi> then <hi>helpful</hi> to the Church.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. So you may say of his Governing the Professors of any Arts or Sciences. 2. Whoever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth may be lyable to such inconveniences. That part of the world that hath escaped the plague of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded by selfish interest and partiality, do know that the Pope and Prelates have been far more guilty of this mis-judging and persecution, then Princes have been: and that Princes have been drawn into almost all their guilt by Popes and Prelates (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing we speak of Christian Princes.) 3. We must not be deprived of the blessing of Government for fear of abuse through humane frailties: No more then we must be against eating, and drinking, and apparel, to avoid gluttony, drunkenness and pride. God hath commanded Magistrates to do their duty: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so far mistake as to become dangerous persecutors of the Church without some grievous negligence or malignity of their own; which if they are guilty of, and will know no mean between <hi>Negligence</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,</hi> they shall bear the blame and punishment from God.</p>
               <p>If Pastors will cast off the work of Preaching, or be negligent in it, all grant that the Magistrate may punish them. And so he may, if they cast off Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and corrupt the Church by admitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the prophane and scandalous: And so may he punish them that will exclude the faithful to the detriment and hazzard of the Churches, or the great injury of the persons themselves. As if a Pastor will gather a Church in a Parish, and exclude the greater part of them that are meet to be received
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170314:195"/> and desire it, submitting to any reasonable terms, when perhaps no other Church is near for them to joyn with. It is meet in this case that the Magistrate allow them a Pastor that will Govern them according to the Word of God. And so in other cases.</p>
               <p>It is therefore an injurious clamour of them that say, <hi>[If Pope and Prelates be laid by, Presbyters will be lawless, and will be every man a Pope in his own Parish; and who shall govern them, or punish them if they offend?]</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Is the Christian Magistrate no body with these men? Are his Laws and Government nothing? Who hath to do with corporal punishing but he? I would we could once see a Pope and Prelates that had no other arms but spiritual: I doubt not but the world would quickly find, how little their Authority will uphold their Kingdom, or maintain their Unity or Strength. If Pastors are to be rejected from Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it concerneth them with whom thev had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: If they are to be fined or punished corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it concerneth the Magistrate alone.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 262. If Magistrates punish Ministers unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, persecute them, they must not resist, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the Magistrate, but patiently suffer the wrong.</q>
               <p>This being commonly consest by Protestants, and plain in it self, I shall take as granted.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 263. If Magistrates forbid Ministers to preach or exercise the rest of their office in their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are to be obeyed, in case that other competent persons are provided for the work, that the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no dangerous detriment by it; but otherwise they are
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170314:195"/> not to be obeyed, but we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="1">1. That <hi>they are to be obeyed</hi> in the <hi>first case</hi> is plain; because it belongeth to them to govern and order the worship of God. <hi>David, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l commodity</hi> (principally) but for God and the common good: If therefore nothing but <hi>personal commodity</hi> be crost, and the <hi>Church not hazarded</hi> or much damnified by it, we have no reason to disobey: Much less when personal commodity it self doth also invite us to consent. And I am of the opinion that the Minister that doth not serve the Lord upon terms of <hi>self denial,</hi> and <hi>suffereth not</hi> (one way or other) more to his flesh by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, then he should do if he were put out of it, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in some extraodinary case) hath greater reason to suspect that he is either a self-seeking man, or at least doth serve God with much unfaithfulness and carnal complyance. We are sure, <hi>Obedience</hi> to Rulers is a <hi>Duty,</hi> and therefore we must not disobey them till we have such reason as may justifie it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet that we <hi>must not obey</hi> in the <hi>other case,</hi> (when it tendeth to the destruction of the Church, or notable damage of mens souls) is plain. 1. Because the Magistrates as well as the Ministers have their Power to Edification and not to destruction. No man hath
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170314:196"/> authority from Christ to destroy his Church or the souls of men. 2. Because our office dependeth as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon Christ, as the office of the Magistrate, and therefore men cannot dispence with us against his will. 3. The Apostles have gone before us with their example, preaching and exercising all their office, though they were both prohibited and beaten; and have taught us to say, <hi>[Whether it be better to obey God or men, judge ye.]</hi> 4. Else it would also warrant all Christians to for bear <hi>praying</hi> and other worship of God, when the Magistrate commandeth it: which neither <hi>Daniel (Dan.</hi> 6.) nor the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or any good Christians did believe. 5. And it would excuse men on these accounts from Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But must we not obey the Magistrate forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us the exercise of our office, if any hurt accrew by it to the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We must prudently consider, Whither the hurt of our silence and forbearing our office, or the hurt of our not obeying the Magistrate, is like to be greater as to the Church; and whether the Benefit of our Ministry, or of our submissive silence, is like to be greater to the Church, and the honour of Christ, and accordingly our choise must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

               <p>Magistrates may not make God any new worship-Ordinances. Circumstances of worship are <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> by God, or <hi>Ʋndetermined.</hi> The former (as the Lords Day) the Magistrate must second by Laws, requiring obedience to Gods Laws. The second sort are <hi>Necessary</hi> or <hi>Ʋnnecessary</hi> to be determined: If <hi>unnecessary,</hi> the Magistrate should not put it into a Law <hi>(N.</hi> a thing may be necessary to be determined, that is not it self comparatively necessary, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have served in its stead.) If the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be <hi>Needful</hi> or <hi>Profitable,</hi> then either <hi>Ordinarily</hi> to a whole Nation, or only mutably <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc.</hi> The later should be left to the Pastors determination: The former the Magistrate may determine: As <hi>e. g.</hi> what Translation of holy Scripture shall be of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like use; What Version of <hi>Psalms</hi> shall be Sung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We need no Bishops for these, if the Magistrate, please.</p>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170314:197"/> for Gods worship it self, but he may make new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for these circumstances of his Worship.</q>
               <p>God hath done the first already. That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may do the second, is plain, in that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of that which is his work: And so he may <hi>circa sacra</hi> make officers, as Church-Wardens to see to the building, and Porters to keep the doors, and Sextons to toll the Bells, look to the utensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Censors to keep peace and order.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 267. Magistrates have the chief Power of the Temples and Church-maintenance; yet so as that they are bound by God, to dispose of it for his Churches great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est benefit.</q>

If the Magistrate command us to forsake the Temples, and put others in possession of them, we must obey. If he take from us the publick maintenance, we must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: When yet (if the Churches good require it) we may be bound to preach without maintenance from him in some other place. Bishops have nothing to do with Temples or Maintenance, but under the Magistrate, by his grant: And yet both are (in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral at least) <hi>jure divine,</hi> of Gods ordination, which cannot be denyed the Church without sin.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 268. Though Magistrates may not lawfully take from the People the Power of choosing or consenting, nor from the Pastors the Power of Ordaining, yet must they oversee both People and Pastors, and not suffer them to choose or order such as are intolerably unfit, but by moderate corrections bring them to a righter choice and Ordination.</q>
               <p n="1">1. Christ hath left the foresaid Power to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and people: and therefore the Magistrate may not take it from them. 2. Yet as he hath left the power of <hi>Governing all</hi> men to the Magistrate, so no man can take <hi>this</hi> from <hi>him.</hi> And he is not to leave people to choose what Ministers <hi>they please,</hi> nor to <hi>Pastors</hi> to ordain <hi>whom they please;</hi> but to see that they do all to the Churches good: None of them can claim a fuller power in his place, then a parent hath over his own children, who yet must be hindred by the Magistrate from wronging them, and forced by him to feed and cloath them, if he deny it.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 179. <hi>A Law</hi> is an ambiguous term, and is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, 1. Sometime for the internal mind of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 2. Sometime for the external products. In the former sence Gods mind and will is called <hi>Lex aeterna;</hi> which properly is but the Fountain of Law, unless you take it as the <hi>Significatum.</hi> In the latter sence, 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is taken for a means of effecting; and sometime
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170314:202"/> for the thing effected on the Subject. In the former sense, sometime it is taken Metaphorically for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Physical causes; and sometime for meer moral potestative Rules: And sometime it is taken Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally for the orderly disposal of inanimates and brutes; and sometime only for Rules to the rational free Agent.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 280. I take the mind of the Law-giver, the setled order of Nature among inanimates or brutes, or man as a <hi>Natural</hi> agent, and also the impress on the soul, as such, to be improperly called Laws: and therefore take not the word in any of these senses.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 281. The Law of Nature and of Grace, are sometime taken for the imprinting signs, and sometime for the Impressed Image: In the latter sense I take them improperly to be called Laws.</q>
               <p>Yet even the <hi>Internal Disposition,</hi> considered not <hi>as a Disposition,</hi> but a sign of Gods Will, I number with the Laws of Nature. But In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So the Law written on our hearts and put into our inwards parts; that is the holy effects of the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in themselves are no Law, but the effects of a Law; unless as secondarily, they become the signs of the will of God imposing further duty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 282. The word <hi>[Law</hi> is also sometime ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so <hi>largely</hi> as to comprehend meer Directions or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170314:202"/> of such as have no Governing power, and also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: But I take it not thus improperly.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 283. By some also it is taken so <hi>narrowly,</hi> as to exclude verbal Precepts, Commissions, Priviledges, temporary Constitutions, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let those men that are not the Masters of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, be content to express their own minds by their own terms, and give us leave to do the like. If any think that the [Name of a Law] should be used more Laxely or more strictly then I use it, he hath his Liberty: Let him have the patience also to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to use mine: and to tell him that my words are to explain my own mind, and not his. It is <hi>Things</hi> and not <hi>words</hi> that I am here to open: And it is that <hi>Thing</hi> which I here define that I treat of, and mean by the word Law. So various are the Definitions of Laws among Polititians and Lawyers, that its not easie to meet with many that agree in one and the same Definition. And therefore among such varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I may have the freer leave to thrust in mine, then if the gowned Tribe had been agreed on some other: especially when 1. I never yet saw many, if any other that I could see reason to be satisfied in. 2. And yet I pretend to no Infallibility; or that mine shall be more perfect then other mens, but only that it is more satisfactory to me: To confute other mens
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170314:203"/> various Definitions would be but odious &amp; tedious.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not so: Promulgation is usually taken for the act of Publication, which followeth the <hi>Enacting</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> of the Law; and is implyed as necessary to the effect of the sign; Of which I shall next speak.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 285. Though to be an <hi>Aptitudinal sign,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> all that is of the Generical Essence; yet to be <hi>Promulgate</hi> and thereby made an <hi>Actual sign,</hi> or to be so far revealed, that the subjects may be informed by it that are not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably negligent is a <hi>condition</hi> necessary to the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Constitution of duty.</q>
               <p>Some had rather distinguish between the <hi>Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Informing</hi> act of Laws, and make the former essential to them, and not the latter, and so reject the distinction of <hi>Aptitudinal</hi> and <hi>Actual signs</hi> here: but groundlesly. To <hi>Represent,</hi> is as ambiguous as to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170314:204"/>
                  <hi>signifie,</hi> and is of the same importance: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have need to distinguish of <hi>one,</hi> so we have of the other. To <hi>Represent Aptitudinally,</hi> by contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that expression of the Superiours will as is Apt to Inform if Revealed, is one thing; and to <hi>Represent actually</hi> to another by the means of Revelation or fit approximation, is another thing. A shilling in my pocket <hi>Aptitudinally signifieth,</hi> or <hi>Representeth</hi> the Soveraign whose Image it beareth: but not <hi>actually</hi> till I take it out and shew it; Nor then neither, <hi>nisi ex parte revelantis,</hi> that is, it is but in <hi>Potentia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximâ,</hi> till the beholder perceive it. So here, 1. A <hi>Law Enacted</hi> is truly a Law, as a <hi>signum aptitudinale</hi> is a <hi>sign:</hi> but it obligeth not yet. 2. A Law En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted and Promulgate obligeth, because the Law-giver hath done his part to the full effect. 3. A Law Received is yet in a nearer capacity for the full effect; but Reception or Actual understanding it, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the obligation.</p>
               <p>Some affirm that <hi>Promulgation</hi> ls essential to a Law. Let them that think so, define it accordingly: I quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel not with them, because I come so near them as that the difference is of no great moment: But yet I consent not: For its one thing to <hi>make a Law,</hi> and another to <hi>promulgate</hi> it. Yet the last is a Condition <hi>sine quanon,</hi> as to obligation. As in Belief, the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it self</hi> is not the formal object of Faith, (that is <hi>Veracitas Revelantis)</hi> nor part of it; nor yet the <hi>material Object</hi> (that is the <hi>Truth Revealed)</hi> but a naturally necessary condition of both, which some call the <hi>vinculum;</hi> so <hi>promulgation</hi> is not essential to Law, nor is it the formal object of our obedience (that is, the Power of the Law-giver) nor the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170314:204"/> (that is, the Law it self) but a necessary means and condition to induce the Obligation; the enacted Law having but the <hi>Potentiam &amp; Aptitudinem obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandi,</hi> which must thus be made actual.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 286. When I say a Law is a sign of the Law-givers <hi>Will,</hi> I imply his understanding signified also: As <hi>Right,</hi> it proceedeth from the Legislators Intellect, and as <hi>Imposed,</hi> it proceedeth from his <hi>Will,</hi> and so is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Intellect and will of the subject for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Obligation or Obedience.</q>
               <p>It is a great controversie whether it be the <hi>Reason</hi> or the <hi>Will</hi> as signified that informeth Laws. On the one side are <hi>T. Aquin. Cajetan. Alens. Richard. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio, Sot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Occam.</hi> and others, as <hi>Suarez</hi> reckoneth them: but doubtless many of them hold as he doth, and as the plain truth is, that it is both: As a <hi>man</hi> is not <hi>man</hi> without an <hi>Intellect and Will,</hi> and as an act of command is not <hi>humane</hi> that proceedeth not from both: and as the Law it self hath both an <hi>Informing</hi> and <hi>Compelling</hi> power; and as it is by the subject to be received both by the <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> so must it <hi>proceed</hi> from <hi>both</hi> in the Law-giver, add <hi>signifie both;</hi> Yet differently: For it proximately proceedeth from his will, and signifieth that as <hi>Obligatory,</hi> not suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens Obedience upon their discerning the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of the Law, which is to be supposed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 287. In the essence of the sign there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Respect of the matter of the sign, 1. To the thing signified. 2. To the will of the Law-giver. 3. To the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170314:205"/> subjects, to whom his will is signified. The thing signified consisteth, 1. Of the matter. 2. The form; that is, Right or Dueness.</q>
               <p>The Law 1. Signifieth the will of the Legislator, as words express the speakers mind. And therefore some make <hi>[the will of the Governour]</hi> to be the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Law; and <hi>as signified,</hi> so it is: but not as <hi>existent</hi> in it self. 2. The Law is a sign respecting the understanding and will of the subject, as the <hi>Terminus</hi> or <hi>finis cui:</hi> It notifieth to the subject the Legislators will. 3. It respecteth the matter <hi>signified, e. g.</hi> that <hi>Chastity, Sobriety, Temperance,</hi> or this or that duty is the matter to which we are obliged. 4. The Law respecteth the form produced by signification, that is, the <hi>Debitum</hi> or <hi>Right,</hi> that is or that shall be <hi>Due:</hi> All these significations are essential to a Law; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that as to the subject, the <hi>Aptitude</hi> is enough, and the <hi>Representation,</hi> whether the person receive <hi>infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> by it, or not.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 288. All Laws being nothing else but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of anothers Reason and Will, it is certain that subjects are not to esteem themselves self-sufficient or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, nor enslaved by being Ruled by the Reason and will of others.</q>
               <p>Gods Reason and will revealed, is the Universal Light and Law of the whole world: The Soveraigns Reason and will, is the subordinate Light and Law of that people whom he governeth; and is the publick Reason and Will of the Common-wealth: Yet with this two-fold limitation. 1. That he have no power
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170314:205"/> against the Light and Law of God. 2. That all the people have a Reason and Will that is private and personal, for the discerning their Duty, and choosing accordingly. But doubtless Gods appointing that the Laws, that is, the Reason and Will of the Soveraign, shall rule the subjects, doth hereby require much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in us, even so far as that we disobey not his highest will.</p>
               <p>And consequently, in many doubtful cases, the Soveraign may be guilty for mis-commanding, when the subject is innocent that obeyeth him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 289. It is no Law that is not the effect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power, or the sign of the Rulers will.</q>
               <p>Authority is the efficient cause of Law, or is the Power of the efficient. Authority is sometime taken for meer Interest, by Wisdom, strength, goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which one man can prevail with others. This is no Law-giving Power. But the <hi>Authority</hi> that must make Laws is nothing else but <hi>Jus regendi,</hi> a <hi>Right to Govern,</hi> which is originally and primitively in God, and Derivatively in the creature. Remember still, that this is it that I mean by <hi>Authority,</hi> or <hi>Power;</hi> and not meer power of Interest by Reputation, nor yet meer nature, strength or force. <hi>Jus pracipientis,</hi> the Right of commanding is the only sufficient cause of <hi>Jus praecepti,</hi> of imposed Right. Yet <hi>Jus concessum</hi> may arise from a more private cause.</p>
               <p>Analogically as man is called a Governor of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so his will and word are called a Law to himself: But this is no such Law as we treat of.</p>

Local and subordinate Laws may be made by others; but only by a Power so Derived from the Supream Ruler, that Originally and mediately they are his Laws, though proximately theirs. That sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may make such Local Statutes by the Soveraigns grant, is maintained by Polititians commonly <hi>(Bocer.

And such acts as these I think are the <hi>[Permission]</hi> that is commonly said to be an act of a Law; For if a <hi>Concession</hi> be not meant by a <hi>Permission,</hi> it will prove no act of Law, but the Negation of an Act, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Suarez</hi> and others truly Note.

               <p>The first act of most publick Laws in order, is the constituting (primarily, or by confirmation) the Right of possessions as Antecedent to obedience or disobedience: The next is <hi>de officiis</hi> in the Precepts and prohibitions.

               <p>Quest. <hi>What if a Soveraign make a Law for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, and call it fundamental, may his Successour change it? Answ.</hi> As a Law, they are not obliged by it from a change, but have the same Power to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it as he had to make it. But yet his <hi>Promise</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in that Law, or his Consent, may oblige his Successors, if they succeed upon his terms, before a Change in the Constitution; if he pass a Law of great necessity for the Publike good, and oblige himself and posterity not to change it, his Covenant obligeth him and them. If the Subjects Covenant must oblige their Posterity, the Princes must also bind his Successors.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But where the Soveraignty is in Prince and Parliament, may they not change a Law which a former Prince and Parliament obliged Posterity not to change? Answ.</hi> If it be Parliament that hath meerly a part in the Supremacy, they may not; because their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors Covenants bind them till God or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (to whom they are bound) shall disoblige them. But if it be a Parliament that also Representeth the People, and is thereby enabled to act in such cases on their behalf, then they may change any Laws or Contracts, (except when a Divine Obligation doth prohibite) Because the people can acquit the Prince of his promises to them, and he can discharge them of theirs to him. But when any Law appeareth to be inconsistent with the Laws of God, or End of Government, God himself then doth dissolve it by
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170314:211"/> his dissent, without whom it can be of no true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 304. It belongeth to the Soveraign Power to make a state a universally-obliging Interpretation of the Laws.</q>
               <p>Judges make particular Interpretations, in order to the Decision of particular cases. But to make an Interpretation which shall be the stated sense of the Law, obliging the subjects as subjects universally, or <hi>per modum Legis, Regularly,</hi> this none but the Law-givers themselves can do.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 305. It belongeth to the Soveraign to dispence with Penal Laws, by pardoning offences▪ and also to dispence with Positive Laws about Duty, when the End and Reason of the Law requireth it: Because his Laws are to bind the subject, and not himself.</q>
               <p>The <hi>Law-giver</hi> is above the <hi>Law;</hi> yet not so that he may dispence with it at his <hi>pleasure,</hi> because he is not above the <hi>End of Laws.</hi> The Law is but the <hi>will of the Law-giver signified:</hi> If he have power of his own will, he hath power of his Laws. He may not alwaies revoke the Decrees of his own will: but that's by accident. It hath ever belonged to the Soveraign to grant a pardon, even for Life: And this is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax the Law: and to Dispence with it as Penal. If Soveraigns are limited from pardoning in certain cases, that is because those cases are exempted from
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170314:212"/> their Power, and so their Soveraignty extends not to them: None but God is an Absolute Soveraign: Man is but Analogically called so, in respect to God: And therefore where he is limited, his Power faileth.</p>
               <p>Penal Laws do make the Penalty Due to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; but do not bind the Law-giver to inflict that penalty directly: but yet <hi>à fine,</hi> &amp;c. he may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 306. A Law being the Instrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Rule of Duty and Judgement, the Law-giver by making it doth oblige himselfe, ordinarily to Govern by it; So that he is engaged in point of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Fidelity, for his Honour, and for the Common good, not rashly to pardon crimes, nor dispence with Laws; but still upon grounds of security as to their ends.</q>
               <p>He that makes an house, doth not say expresly, that it shall be inhabited: but interpretatively he doth: For being a wise man, it is supposed that he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in vain, nor useth a means when he intendeth not the end; which is indeed not to use it as a means. He that maketh a Law, doth interpretatively say, <hi>By this I will govern:</hi> And therefore he doth in prudence and fidelity oblige himself to Govern by it, and not to dispence with it, but seldom, and upon weighty cause, and alwaies with a sufficient <hi>salvo</hi> as to the end of the Law and Government.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 307. He that dispenceth with a Law upon just occasion, doth not thereby become a Lyar, nor make the Law speak falsely: because it speaketh but <hi>de De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito,</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:170314:212"/> and not directly <hi>de Eventu,</hi> as it is a Law.</q>

As was last said, interpretatively the Governour intimateth that ordinarily he will Govern by it. 3. But yet a Law as a Law doth not speak directly <hi>de Eventu,</hi> nor engage the Governour in point of Veracity alway to fulfill it. As for instance: The Law that saith, <hi>[He that committeth Treason, Felony,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be put to death:]</hi> doth not mean <hi>de eventu,</hi> that it shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 308. As no Law-giver can dispence with Gods Laws, nor with the necessary means of the common safety, so neither may he dispence with his own Covenants, nor deprive any causelesly of their Right, nor <hi>ordinarily</hi> or <hi>causelesly</hi> dispence with his own Laws, nor when the ends of Government forbid it.</q>
               <p>Here are many cases in which a Ruler may not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. 1. He may not dispence with Gods Laws, because he hath no Authority thereto. 2. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants he is bound to obey in point of fidelity, to which he is obliged by the Law of God. 4 He cannot take away any mans Right from him: for that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and injury to the person: And therefore he cannot Dispence with a Donation or full promise, as he can with a Penal Law. A Pollicitation may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked: for it doth but express a <hi>Purpose to Give</hi> such or such a <hi>Benefit,</hi> and doth <hi>not give it:</hi> And a man upon sufficient cause, may change his <hi>Purposes:</hi> But a <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It is a matter of exceeding moment to the safety and welfare of the People, that Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates be. men fearing God, Prudent, just, of publick spirits, and conragious, hating impiety, vice and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: And therefore next to the making of Good Laws, it is the Soveraigns principal work to be exceeding care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his choice of Officers, and to keep out insinuating unworthy men.</q>
               <p>If we have a just and pious Soveraign, and have impious unrighteous Judges or Justices, &amp;c. the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may groan and languish in continual oppression and misery. Dead Laws will not preserve them against Living Wolves and Foxes. Poverty, and distance, and friendlesness doth usually disable the poor oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed people to prosecute an Appeal to an higher Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. From whence it comes to pass that Laws themselves grow odious; and poor men think it is at any time better, if a Rich man do but demand of them half their estates, to let him take it, rather then by seeking to preserve it at Law, to lose all. All vice will flourish under impious Magistrates: Piety and honesty will be mens outward calamity. If Soveraigns look not exceeding strictly to their Officers, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be unhappy: And discontents will be raised against the Government: and the people will easily think that the Soveraign chooseth such as himself, or as are most agreeable to his mind: And when once the Soveraign is brought into a common distaste with the people, the Common-wealth is sick of such an
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170314:214"/> Head-ake as threatneth some worse disease. Nothing scarce ever lost Princes more then impious, flattering, unrighteous Officers. And scarce any thing doth more ingratiate a Prince with the People, then to find that he sets faithful Magistrates over them; and also to hear that he enquireth after, and feverely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the unjust: This greatly endeareth him to the people.</p>

               <p>With most Princes few have Honour and Power but those that seek it, and ambitiously turn every stone to attain it: And few that are Ambitious of it and seek it, are worthy of it: And consequently few worthy persons are in Power, in comparison of what might be, if Princes did their duty. As the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were wont to repell the seekers of the Pastoral office, and to seek after them that hid themselves or fled from it, somewhat of this is imitable by Princes in the choice of Magistrates. First they must be sure to choose such as are most worthy: and next, such as are not unacceptable to the people; that is, to the generali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

               <p>I know that no Sentence is absolutely final but Gods: and that the Judgement of men is of small moment, if it be not the Judgement of God by them. The Judge of all the world is at the door. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Princes of the earth shall be there Judged. Thats the day that turns the scales to an everlasting Happiness or misery. It is the Joy
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170314:215"/> of Believers, that under all the oppressions of the unjust, and the persecutions of the Malignant, they have room for an Appeal to the Barr of God, where no injustice shall find place. But till then there is no removing of our Cause to an higher Court then that where the Soveraign power is the Judge. Though it is not meet for Princes to allow Appeals to themselves too commonly, yet should they do their utmost to relieve oppressed innocency. Of the controversies about the Soveraigns Judgment, I have spoke in part before. As we must reverence the sentence of these earthly Judges, because they are Commissioned by the Lord, and the Judgement is his, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be with them in his work: So must we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably patient under all those injuries from men, which temporal judgements will not, or cannot right us against, because that we are the subjects of the Heavenly King, and that the Judge of all the world will do righteously, and that we are near, yea very near the day, when all will be set straight, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured shall have full relief: and they that have cryed day and night to God for help and Justice, shall find that he will avenge them speedily: and the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous shall not be in vain, nor will their Rock, their King, their Father fail them.</p>

               <p>Because the right understanding of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, is of great use for our guidance in these weighty points, I shall stay a while upon the search of that <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. which saith most; and if we understand that, it will be the easier to understand the rest.</p>
               <p>Many occasions concurred to make this document of the Apostle necessary to the <hi>Romans.</hi> 1. There were Hereticks crept in among them that abused the doctrine of Christian Liberty, and perswaded them that subjection to the Rule of Magistrates was against their Liberty. 2. And the weaker Christians were the easier induced to entertain this doctrine in part, because they were Heathen Magistrates that they were under. And the Christians, being (justly) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Apostles to go to Law about personal in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170314:216"/> not fit to be the Governors of Christians. 3. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because many of the Christian had been Jews, that were hardly brought to any but a forced submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion unto Gentile Rulers; and were ever prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against them, thinking it an honourable vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their holy state and Church, which they thought no Heathen had right to Rule over. The first Hereticks rising from the Jewish Christians, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing so palpably in this and other things, and the weaker sort of the Jewish Christians being so prone to hearken to them, gave great occasion to the Apostle thus to press the doctrine of subjection.</p>
               <p>Where note, that the main question here resolved, is, <hi>Whether Magistracy, and Heathen Magistrates should be submitted to as Gods Ordinance for conscience sake?</hi> And so it was about the very state of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which among us Christians is a matter past doubt; though we are not all agreed about <hi>obedience</hi> in some particular cases.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Precept</hi> it self is laid down in the first verse, <hi>[Let every soul be subject to the higher powers]</hi> The first moving Argument is drawn from the efficient cause, which is God. 1. In general Magistracy is his Institution <hi>[There is no power but from God]</hi> And so it is he that sets up Magistrates, and they are <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to him, and have a power derived from him <hi>[The Powers that be are ordained of God.]</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions hence inferred are <hi>v.</hi> 2. that <hi>therefore 1. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever resisteth the power, resisteth Gods own Ordinance,</hi> that is, both breaks his Law, and resisteth a Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him, and consequently resisteth God. 2.

[What can be expected from Heathens (might the Christians say) but acts of enmity? They will still be persecuting us] The Apostle at once answering this, and arguing <hi>à fine</hi> for subjection, tells them, that Magistrates have their office to be a <hi>terrour to evil works,</hi> and not to good: And therefore let us do good, and if the office be used but according to its instituted nature, we shall have praise from Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and need not fear them.

               <p>Quest. 8. <hi>When did God [ordain] the Powers? and by what act?

In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Law of nature, he subjected man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the woman to the man, and (by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) children to their parents, and in general, at least after the fall, made Magistracy and Subjection necessary to the world. The more men sinned, the more he gave them up to humane Government, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170314:219"/> as they rebelled and departed from him, so he forsook them, as to his special Government in way of mercy. He kept himself the Soveraignty over his peculiar people of <hi>Israel</hi> in a more eminent way of exercise then over any other. 1. He made their common Laws for Government. 2. He chose himself their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Magistrate; a limited Monarch to be his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or chief Officer. 3. He appointed a course for choice of the <hi>Sanbedrim.</hi> 4. He enabled them for their work. 5. He kept the chief Judicature in his hands, resolving their doubts, and deciding their most difficult cases by his Oracles. But when they were aweary of this Theocracy, he withdrew from them according to their corrupt desires, and left them to their desired King: Yet did he not <hi>wholly</hi> forsake them, but only in that <hi>measure</hi> as they had forsaken and cast off him.</p>

               <p>Quest. 11 <hi>Must we obey no Rulers but such as are here described, as are not a terrour to the good, but the evil? Answ.</hi> If the very drift and work of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were for evil works and against good, then they acted as the Devils substitutes, and could not be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, nor servants of God, but nullifie their office as to them. But if it be but in some particular cases that they are against Good, and for Evil, and such as nullifie not their office; then we must not deny subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them: but how far we may or may not resist, shall be shewed anon.</p>
               <p>Quest. 12 <hi>How could</hi> Nero <hi>be said to be an encourager of Good, and a terror to evil, and such an one as is here described? Answ.</hi> 1. It is <hi>directly</hi> to <hi>Magistracy as such</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> requireth subjection: And therefore he describeth it as it is in Gods Institution. 2. Yet it is also Magistracy as in those particular men: But then the Apostle considereth them partly as <hi>obliged</hi> to be such as he describeth, and partly as <hi>professing</hi> to be such; for so did <hi>Nero:</hi> and partly as being actually such in many things. In matters of common equity, and against moral evil, and for that good which the Law of Nature revealeth, the Roman Laws might well in the main be said to be a <hi>terrour to evil works, and not to good;</hi> though in the matters of supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral revelation they were perverse: And <hi>Nero</hi> was to Govern by these <hi>Laws:</hi> And there were multitudes of Officers besides <hi>Nero</hi> that were to be Judge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute according to these <hi>Laws:</hi> And the Apostle had respect to these. And the Senate had part still in the Soveraignty it self. But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>Quest. 13. <hi>But how could</hi> Nero <hi>he said to be the

The Apostle lookt at the whole frame of Government, Laws, Senate, Officers, as well as at <hi>Nero. 2. Nero</hi> had the Consent of Senate and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this. 3. Settled possession sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Consent: For the people are the strength: and the strongest can resist, if they will: and they that can and do not, shew that they will not. 4.

               <p>He that obeyeth upon any other account excluding this, doth not obey a Magistrate as a Magistrate, but as an Idol, or as one that is able to do him good or hurt: and so it is <hi>himself</hi> that he serveth in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and there is no Divine obedience in it. But a Christian understandeth that God is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the first and last; and that <hi>of him, and through him, and to him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11. 36. And therefore he intendeth God in all, and dependeth on him in all; and doing all for him and by his command, all things are sanctified that he doth, and from God he shall receive his reward.

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 328. It is a great Controversie, Whether a subject may fight at a Princes command when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the cause to be just, or when he knoweth it to be unjust? Answ 1. If he know it to be unjust, he may not; (except Accidentally <hi>aliun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>è</hi> some further prevalent Reason warrant it.) 2. If he know it not to be unjust, when it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so, because he doth not his duty to know, he is bound to do that duty, and knowing to forbear. 3. If he know it not to be unjust, because he hath no capacity to discover the unjustice, nor to judge of it, then he may bear arms.</q>
               <p n="1">1. The guilt of blood is so heavy a thing that no man should draw it upon himself or his Prince: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just war is murdering: And no man should murder in obedience to a Prince, when God condemneth it. 2. The Accidental exceptions <hi>à fine,</hi> &amp;c. I shall speak of among the Affirmative Propositions. 3. Wilful ignorance will not excuse a man from the guilt of murder, though a King command it. But the person is at once obliged to use means for his better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to lay by his errour, and to forbear the sin. 4. But when the sin or unjustness of the war is not notorious, nor within our reach to know it, then we must obey our Rulers that are the Judges or discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the case: For, 1. Rulers may not open all causes of a war to all the Souldiers: Sometime the case requireth such secrecie and expedition, as will not consist with that. 2. Subjects by reason of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and disacquaintance are usually incompetent Judges of such cases. 3. And if they should never fight till they know the Justness of the cause, they
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170314:225"/> would neglect the Necessary Defence of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and Countrey.</p>
               <p>Yet, if there be not competent knowledge that it is a good cause, men should not thrust on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor go to war without some kind of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 329. The same answer serveth to that other Controversie, Whether a subject may execute an unjust Sentence of a Prince or Judge?</q>
               <p>If it concern the Common-wealth directly (or nearly) he must suspend his execution till he have competent satisfaction: As if he were commanded to put to death some persons of great Eminency and Interest in the Common-wealth. But if it be but against a private person (as the hanging a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for felony, the shooting to death a Souldier condemned for mutiny) here if the unjustice be not notorious, and you see no great cause to suspect it, and be not negligent in doing what concerneth you in your place, for due information, you may do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, if you are commanded. But not, if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice be notorious, or such as you may well discover, without transgressing your bounds in the enquiry. In such cases, Princes should find no Executioners: And the Executioners are guilty of the crime: For God is to be obeyed more then man. <hi>Doeg</hi> was cursed for slaying the Priests at King <hi>Saul's</hi> command. It cost the Captains and Souldiers their lives that would have surprized <hi>Elias</hi> at the Kings command. <hi>Obadiah</hi> is blessed that saved the Prophets; and so are the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Mid-wives that saved the <hi>Israelites</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170314:225"/> whom the King commanded to destroy. Many that have been Executiones in the Martyrs death, have had exemplary plagues. Its the Legal way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining Kings from unjustice, to punish their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners that are subjects, that others may fear obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in wickedness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 330. A Soveraign that is an Heretick, or wicked man, yea Infidel or Heathen, must be obeyed in all lawful things: but with an Obedience answerable to his Authority.</q>
               <p>I shall open this together with the next <hi>Thesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 331. He that hath no such Right to Govern, as will justifie himself for it before God, may yet be such whom we are obliged to obey.</q>
               <p>We have here one of the weightyest and difficultest cases about <hi>Obedience,</hi> before us. It is very hard to conceive how an Infidel or Heathen can have any Right of Government, because they deny the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Soveraign from whom they must derive their Right, or they can have none: And how can a Rebel receive Authority? And why should we obey him that hath no Authority? Nay is it not impossible, when <hi>Authoritas Imperantis</hi> is the <hi>formal object of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</hi> Also will it not follow that the <hi>Pope</hi> should be obeyed that is no Infidel or Heathen?</p>
               <p>And yet Christ, and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> have so plainly decided the case, that the Heathen Magistrates that were in their daies were to be obeyed, that we must needs take that for a certain truth. And therefore we
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170314:226"/> have only to consider upon what ground, and how f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r they are to be obeyed, and to answer the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; praelationis; <hi>but till the Church do depose them, (which it forbeareth sometime to avoid scandal) we must obey them, and pay them tribute to avoid scandal too]</hi> And so he interpreteth the Texts of Scripture that command subjection to Infidel Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as being only to keep us <hi>from offence.</hi> But this agreeth not with the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> that saith, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soul must be subject even for conscience sake, and as to the Ministers of God.</hi> To <hi>obey</hi> only to avoid offence, is not <hi>to obey at all:</hi> It is but the <hi>matter</hi> of that which is Obedience in another: For the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> is wanting, if it be not done <hi>for the Authority of the Commander:</hi> Even as that is no <hi>Belief</hi> which is not <hi>for the Authority or credit of the affirmer.</hi> But sure it is <hi>true subjection</hi> that is commanded us.</p>
               <p>The Truth, as I conceive, lieth thus. 1. If the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi> of a Prince be not notorious, he is no <hi>Infidel</hi> to you and me, and then there is no doubt. As in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> so in the <hi>Magistracy,</hi> if he be <hi>in the place,</hi> and not a <hi>notorious Ʋsurper,</hi> he is an <hi>Officer to me:</hi> The <hi>Benefit of the subject</hi> from <hi>Magistracy</hi> (and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry)</hi> is <hi>first</hi> considerable: They are <hi>means to our good.</hi> The <hi>Duty</hi> is in order to the <hi>Benefit.</hi> We have <hi>Title
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170314:226"/> to the Benefits</hi> of the office, though an Usurper be in the place. And having right to the <hi>Benefit,</hi> must do the <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Ruler be <hi>notoriously</hi> an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> yet he is supposed to own <hi>a God,</hi> even <hi>one highest God,</hi> that is most perfect in Power, Wisdom and Goodness, and to profess himself a subject of God, and an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer under him to punish evil doers, and encourage well-doers: This the Heathens did profess. But withall they knew not the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> nor the <hi>True God aright,</hi> with a saving knowledge, but dishonoured him by worshipping many Idols in conjunction with him. And in the execution of their offices, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Christianity, though they encouraged Moral Vertue. What then must we think of such? 1. It is better for the world to have <hi>such Governours</hi> then <hi>none.</hi> And therefore they did <hi>more good then hurt.</hi> There never was among those Heathens so bloody a persecutor, that did not save the lives of many from persecution, for one that they destroyed. For it is the rabble rout of the Vulgar that are the bloodyest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors: Where the Emperours killed an hundred Christians, had they but turned loose the vulgar rabble, they would have killed a thousand, or made an end of them. We should have ten thousand Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for one, if there were no Rulers to restrain the Serpentine Malignant enmity that is in the multitude of the ungodly. 2. Seeing therefore that we have preservation and benefit by them as Governours, we owe them duty as Governours. 3. They are <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically Rulers,</hi> having an <hi>Analogical Authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecti generis.</hi> As they own a God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to worship God, and to preserve peace
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170314:227"/> and order in the world, and punish vice, and promote vertue, according to the Law of Nature, so they are <hi>in tantum</hi> truly Magistrates. But as they deny the Redeemer, and corrupt the doctrine of the God-head, so they fall short of that depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the fountain of Authority; that should make them <hi>fully</hi> men of power. 4. They are accordingly to be obeyed with obedience proportioned to their Authority, and no more. 5. How far an Atheist or Infidel is to be rejected, I shall mention anon under the Affirmatives. 6. Even those that by <hi>Atheism,</hi> or <hi>doing more hurt then good,</hi> do nullifie their Magistracy, may yet be <hi>materially,</hi> though not <hi>formally</hi> obeyed to avoid evils that else would fall upon our selves, or upon the Church or Common-wealth. 7. And pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men may not lay hands on them, as long as God and the Common-wealth (or body of the Nation) forbear them. If a Justice of Peace renounce the King, and yet go on to execute the Laws, and if the King be one that can seize on him at his pleasure, and willingly forbeareth him, the subject must let him alone, and obey all that he commandeth according to Law, till the King lay hands on him, or forbid obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him. 8. Such persons therefore have no right <hi>Coram Deo</hi> to govern, which will justifie them against the accusation of Usurpation or Treason against God: But yet the people may be bound to obey them (though they know this) not as so Authorized, but as being in the seat or place of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and commanding in Gods name by his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary permission. If a Traytor come and charge me to obey the Kings Laws, I will obey them <hi>as the Kings,</hi> though <hi>formally</hi> I obey not <hi>him;</hi> But if he be one
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170314:227"/> that the <hi>King permitteth</hi> in a place of power, I will obey <hi>him</hi> also, so it be not against <hi>the King.</hi> So is it in this case, about Infidel and Heathen Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</p>
               <p>And now the objections need no further answer. The grand Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> Power from him, because they deny him) is answered in this that hath been said. The other Objection (that this would infer obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Pope) is easily answered: The <hi>Office it self</hi> of the <hi>Papacy</hi> is erected by man <hi>against the Will of Christ.</hi> An Infidel King is in an <hi>Office</hi> of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, though the <hi>person</hi> be half unfit: But the <hi>Pope</hi> is in an <hi>Office</hi> that God condemneth, whatever the person be. And therefore a sinful office may not be obeyed by us at all.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 332. To obey a man that is known to have no Powers is not of it self unlawful, so the office or thing commanded be not forbidden.</q>
               <p>For we are commanded to subject our selves one to another, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. and in honour to prefer each other. I may obey any man that commandeth me, even if it be to give him my Cloak, or Coat, or go with him so many miles: So be it there be not some accident that makes it sinful: As if it seem to own an unjust Authority to the publick scandal; or if it will encourage the Usurper in his sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this also is no plea for the lawfulness of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope, whose Office is unlawful, and who is the enemy of Common-wealths, while he proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself the Lord of Princes. Saith an old Poet

If a private man must first know his Princes Genealogie, or have satisfactory evidence of his Title to the Crown, before he be obliged to obey, then obedience would be rare, and Princes must take another course to acquaint their subjects with their Titles, then hitherto they have thought meet to use.

               <p>In two cases this is evident, (which contain the particular cases.) 1. The Covenants between Prince and people contain some particulars oft times that are
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:170314:230"/> not of Necessity to the Being of the common good, but only to the <hi>melius esse,</hi> or to the good of some particular persons. If the Prince or Senate, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Soveraign, break such Covenants, they offend, but do not thereby forfeit their Soveraignty; unless (which is not to be supposed) it were agreed between them, that this should be a forfeiture: Nor may men resist, in such a case of breach, in smaller things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Covenants, or Law allow it them. 2. If the Soveraign should violate his Covenants, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution it self in matters Fundamental, which the common good doth lie upon, and yet do this but in some one Act, which he persisteth not in, but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into his way, and is not a stated habituated offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this kind; it cannot be taken for a forfeiture of his Power, nor sufficient to warrant men to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw subjection, unless it were so expressed in the Covenants or Laws.

Materially men may be obliged to obey (that is, to do the thing commanded) in prudence to avoid an evil to the Nation or themselves. But formal obedience is due to none but such as are in Authority, or seem to have Authority, and so <hi>quoad nos</hi> are truly Governours, though perhaps their Title <hi>ceram Deo</hi> may not be good.

If a Lawful King be limited, if he Command the subjects beyond his Limits, in matters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from his power, or else in matters that the nature of his office extendeth not unto, that command is not an act of power; and therefore it is not a resistance of Power to disobey it.</q>
               <p>The Resistance of a person in power, in a point wherein he hath no Power, is not to resist Power, (that is, <hi>Jus regendi)</hi> but the will of a private man: For he is a private man in all things exempted from his Power. 1. A School-master hath nothing to do to command his Scholars in matters about their trades
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170314:231"/> and callings in the world, but only in matters of learning and manners, because it belongeth not to his Office. A Captain hath no Power (as such) about mens estates, but only about the manners and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actions of his Souldiers, in <hi>order</hi> to his military ends. If a Judge of one Court step into another without Commission, <hi>in alieno foro,</hi> his Sentence is null, and no man bound to obey it. So if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster presume to command in things belonging to the Magistrate, and not to him, his act is private, vain and null. So if a Soveraign will turn Physitian, and command all men to take this or that Physick only, not in order to publike good, but private health; or if he will turn Pastor and do things proper to a Pastor of the Church, his acts are private and null, as being without the verge of his vocation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And where his Covenants with his people limit him, he hath no power in the excepted points; <hi>e. g.</hi> if he be restrained from raising Taxes without the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples consent, if he yet command the payment of such taxes, he doth it not by Authority: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor man did ever give him Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. If the Constitution restrain him from raising war without the consent of the Senate, and yet he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do it, it is not an act of Authority, for he never had Authority thereto.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God hath limited him. 2.

And the people having <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> may force him to such Covenants as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to their security, before they choose him to be their King. No man or family hath Originally more right to Govern a Nation then the rest, till <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> allow it them. Few Princes will plead a successive Right of <hi>Primogeniture</hi> from <hi>Noah.</hi> If the people then say, <hi>[We choose you, (and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily successively) to Rule us on these and no other terms; Accept these terms, or we accept not you.]</hi> If he thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them, he obligeth himself, and all his successors, that will Rule on that foundation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Not obeying,</hi> is the first and chief <hi>Resisting;</hi> And that is proved lawful before, which proveth this also. He <hi>Resisteth</hi> not Power or Authority, that <hi>Resisteth</hi> only the <hi>will</hi> of a man, that (in that) hath no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: Indeed if the Constitution should be (which is not to be imagined) that the Prince shall have no Power in this or that, and yet if he assume it, none shall resist him, then men are restrained from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. Otherwise in those points he is a private man. Yet <hi>accidentally</hi> Resistance may become a sin
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170314:232"/> or a Duty. If it cannot be done without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon loss and hurt, by dishonouring and deposing the Governour, it is a sin by accident. If it be necessary to restrain his usurpation, and to secure the publick good, it will be a duty, and no indifferent thing.</p>
               <p>If I be bound to obey or not resist, where there is <hi>no Authority</hi> to require my obedience, then it must be somewhat distinct and separated from Authority that I am bound to: And what that is, must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. It can be but Accidental: and that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the point.</p>
               <q>

               <p>If there be a Law forbidding Resistance, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due soever the penalty be, that Law must restrain us. But that Law it self that obligeth <hi>aut ad obedientiam, aut poenam,</hi> obligeth not to punishment, but in case of disobedience. The action therefore of such an unjust afflicter, is without Authority: And therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be formally in obedience unto him that I must submit (unless to some other Law.) But it may be an act of formal obedience <hi>to God,</hi> that requireth me to submit to the unjust afflictions of men, when they cannot be resisted without deturbing or dishonouring the Governours, to the injury of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

               <p>They are Private men in matters without the verge of their Commissions. If a Constable usurpe the Office of a Justice, or a Justice of a Judge, or one Judge of another, their commands are null and may be resisted by disobedience, and by force too, unless where the Law for Peace and order doth forbid it. No man doubts but the Soveraign may authorize us to resist his Officers, when they transgress their bounds.</p>

                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 344. No humane Soveraign hath Authority to forbid what God commands, nor to command what God forbids; but their Laws that are notoriously contrary to the Laws of God, are nullities, and cannot oblige to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or punishment.</q>
               <p>A Constable or Justice may a thousand-fold more excusably pretend Authority against the King, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent on him, then a King can claim Authority against God, or independent on him. There is no Power but from God; God giveth none against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. All Laws or commands of men are null, or void of true obliging Authority, which are against his Laws. They are not words of <hi>Authority</hi> but of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> or <hi>Ʋsurpation,</hi> that command us to disobey the God of heaven. To resist such a command, is not to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170314:233"/> Resist an act of Power, but of <hi>Ʋsurpation.</hi> For there can be no Power without, much less against the fountain of all power, the universal Soveraign. It may be this is the meaning of the School-men and Polititians, that say <hi>it is no Law which is unjust;</hi> and of <hi>Augustine</hi> that makes Justice essential to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, de Civit.

               <p>Yet as God requireth us to yield for peace sake to men that have no Authority, and rather then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged or break Charity and Peace, to go two miles with him that would compell us to go one, and to give our coat to him that takes away our cloak; so much more <hi>finis gratia,</hi> for the sake of Charity, Peace and Order, he requireth us to suffer wrongs from <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and not disturb the publick peace for our private interest.

               <p>For 1. To ravish her is no act of Authority, and therefore to Resist is no Resisting of Authority, but of lust. 2.

               <p>The Reason is most evident; 1. <hi>Afortiore:</hi> If the life and chastity of a single person may be rescued by force from the Will and Instruments of a destroying and unchast King, much more may a Nation or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament be so rescued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have a concurrence of many greatest obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to such a rescue. 1. Parliaments we call out about our work, and trust them to secure our Interest, and therefore to forsake them to the will of the unjust is to betray them. 2. There is the highest Reason for Natural self-preservation, to preserve a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. The honour and interest of God, is most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in publike interest. He that thinks a Parliament or Nation should lay their necks upon the block, or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly perish whenever a King would have it so, hath soft so much of humanity, that he is unfit to be <hi>Civis,</hi> a member of a Commonwealth. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was not

The destruction of the Body of the People, or of the Common good, can never be an act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in their King or other Governours (except they had a special command for it from God:) And therefore no Justice can be pretended for it.</q>
               <p>The Reason is most evident: For, if the King will justly destroy the people, he must do it as a <hi>Governour by Vindictive Justice,</hi> or <hi>as a self-defender,</hi> or <hi>as an Enemy by warre:</hi> But none of these wayes must he do it. <hi>An enemy</hi> he is not, if a King: or <hi>no King,</hi> if <hi>an enemy.</hi> It cannot be a necessary means to <hi>self-defence:</hi> For he that can destroy a Nation, can much easier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from them: Nor may the lives of so many be cut off as a meanes to preserve one. And by way of <hi>Governing Justice,</hi> it may not be: For that punitive Justice, being an act of Government, is to the common <hi>end</hi> of Government: and that is ever, the <hi>common good:</hi> and the <hi>common hurt</hi> (in a vindictive or destructive sort) cannot be sought and used <hi>for the common good,</hi> they being contraries. All punishment is of <hi>particular members for the common good.</hi> The lives of particular persons are cut off, for common good. But it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the end, and so to the essence of Government, and therefore of Governing Justice, to destroy the common good. It's true that <hi>Amalek</hi> and the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> were cut off, and Nations destroyed; but 1. That was for sin against the <hi>Ʋniversall King,</hi> that had power over them; 2. And it was by his <hi>speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> 3. And that to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and not to their

                  <hi>own Kings.</hi> A Nation so wicked and implacable, as that their peace or lives is inconsistent with the peace and lives of the neighbour Nations, do warrant them to destroy them for the safety of themselves. And if one Province in a Kings Dominions, were such to all the rest, if he could finde no other remedy to preserve the more excellent parts of his Dominions, he might do it by the destruction of the implacable. But the destroying of his own people, even the greatest or most excellent part, cannot be made just or lawfull by any meanes or pretence whatever, without a special command from God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. No King hath any power, but what is for God and the common good: therefore he hath no power to make warre against the common good.

               <p n="2">2. Every subject is by nature, and <hi>Relation,</hi> bound to preserve the Commonwealth in his place, as well as the King: and therefore none of them can be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments against it.</p>

Though it were the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the King, it cannot be justly preferred before the common good: For even his Prerogative, as his Office and Government it self, are the meanes to this.</p>
               <p>Two things indeed are above the common good of a Nation: One is the Interest, Pleasure and Honour of God himself. The other is the good of the world; or of many and greater Nations round about.

               <p>The Reason it is plain in what is said: 1. If not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his <hi>Rights,</hi> but his <hi>very Office</hi> and <hi>Administration</hi> be <hi>propter bonum publicum,</hi> then may he not plead or defend those Rights <hi>contra bonum publicum:</hi> But the

               <p n="2">2. An excessive penalty beyond the proportion of the offence, may make that cause bad, that else would have been good; The danger or ruin of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or its felicity is such a punishment. If a King be wronged, he must be righted according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his wrong: whatever is against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, especially in the great matters of its safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and felicity, is incomparably above the proportion of his wrong: It is more injustice to seek the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the common good, for a real injury to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle person, then it was in them to do that injury.</p>

               <p>Reasons of the Antecedent: 1. The very miseries of a warre do hazzard all the saftety and felicity, yea the <hi>being</hi> of the Commonwealth.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Otherwise they should never use meanes for their security: For it's easie to say, <hi>I intend not the common hart:</hi> And who will not say it, how hostile soever his actions be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> War is not an act of <hi>Government,</hi> but <hi>Hostility.</hi> Men are not in reason to be supposed to intend their enemies good.

A Nation conquered by the sword, hath no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their safety, liberty or felicity: If they ever have it, it must be from the mercy of the Conquerour. He that puts himself into a garb and state of <hi>Hostility,</hi> is not to be trusted to for mercy, but when there is no other remedy. When a Nation hath lost their just <hi>security</hi> for safety, liberty and felicity, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively lost their safety, liberty and felicity it self. In the Constitution it is now supposed, that they provided for the <hi>security</hi> of the <hi>Common good,</hi> and put not the lives and states of all men, into the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170314:240"/> power</hi> of one man, that all should live or die at his beck, and the Nation perish, if he fell into a phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Now Conquest depriveth them of their <hi>security.</hi> They are then at the mercy of the Conquerour: therefore the Constitution is altered; and <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively all is gone.</hi> The King may mean better: But Kingdoms and common Felicity are not all to be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, upon the secret unknown good meanings and good wills of Kings.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Prince is not his own strength. If he <hi>govern</hi> by his own <hi>Wisdome and Vertue,</hi> yet must he <hi>execute</hi> by others strength.

Those that the King conquereth by, may master him when they please: They are stronger then he. His good meanings therefore are no security to the Nation, if he conquer them by such as mean them hurt, or as the Nation hath no cause to trust. Especially when it is so commonly, that the Conquerours have a self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest opposite to that of the conquered; and that self-interest so much ruleth the world. It is a plain case then, that whatsoever is secretly intended, the Nation is to suppose it to be against their felicity, when they are the Party that War is raised against. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that no War can be lawfully raised by a King against his people (that is, the Body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) because none can be lawfully raised against the common Good.</p>

But if this will not do, if their injury be too great to be born, they may lay down their Crowns at pleasure, Crowns are not like Lands, that men hold primarily, <hi>Jure Dominij:</hi> They are not primarily the matter of <hi>Propriety.</hi> Government (that's Lawfull, and not Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny) is a <hi>meanes to publike good.</hi> When any mans possession of his Crown doth <hi>cease</hi> to be a <hi>meanes to the publike Good,</hi> and this without the peoples injury, it is then his duty to resign it, and no injury to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it. For the meanes is no meanes when it is against the end. If the Nation <hi>injuriously</hi> deprive themselves of a worthy Prince, the hurt will be their own, and they punish themselves: But if it be necessarily to their welfare, it is no injury to him.</p>
               <p>But the King that by War will seek reparations from the body of the People, doth put himself into a <hi>hostile state,</hi> and tell them actually that he looks to his own good more then theirs, and bids them take him for their enemy, and so defend themselves if they can.</p>

               <p>The Conclusion needs no proof; because Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty as such hath the Power of Arms, and of Laws themselves.

Those therefore that will judge of the power of Princes by their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or Names, and thence fetch Arguments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve mens consciences, know not what a narrow foundation they build on: Of which see Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> against <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Politicks.</p>

               <p>The Reason is plain: Because though they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny natural persons, they are all but one civil person; and because that all the power of Arms here is either <hi>defensive against Enemies,</hi> or <hi>vindictive and punitive against offending Subjects.</hi> But none in soveraignty while such, are to be taken as enemies: And neither

               <p n="1">1. It is notorious to the Nation, when the King and Senate (that are now supposed to be sharers in the Soveraignty) do disagree, and fall into hostility and open War, that the frame of the fundamental Constitution is dissolved. And when the ship is split or sinking, it's time for the passengers to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their goods as well as they can: When the house is on fire, we must shift for our selves and that we have: When the Government dissolveth it self, they that possessed it turn us loose to rule our selves, and defend our selves. If a man fight against himself, he is to be held as a distracted man: And so should King and Senate be in such a case, being but one civil person: But if any will rush in, and help one hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:170314:246"/> the other, the people must either fall on <hi>them,</hi> or otherwise secure themselves. In this case the Prince hath no offensive power against the Senate, nor the Senate against the Prince: and therefore we should so obey neither, nor help neither, <hi>as such:</hi> But if we see that all <hi>will not</hi> be so wise or honest, but some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents <hi>will</hi> adhere to one of the parties, and some foolish people to the other, we must then look to the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>And here if one party have the juster cause <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> we must adhere to that part; not as authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed primarily against the other, but as justly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves against them. But <hi>si caetera non sint pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> that is, if the welfare of the Commonwealth lie on one side more then the other, yea though that side had at first begun the wrong, (much more if that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were just and innocent) we must joyn with that part: yea or against both, if the safety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth require it. For then we go not against Authority; neither King nor Senate having Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (unless to defend themselves and the Nation) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other. And surely whether we may save the Commonwealth <hi>against Authority</hi> or not, there is no doubt but we may save it <hi>without</hi> any <hi>governing Authority,</hi> when it is <hi>not against it.</hi> Nature that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth self-preservation to all, that sorseit not their lives, doth eminently require <hi>a Nation</hi> to preserve themselves; their common welfare being a thing that can be forfeited to none but God, and neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; not to any within themselves.

The <hi>Defender</hi> may have a just War against the <hi>Invader,</hi> by the grounds of nature: But neither of their causes is to be preferred to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> And if <hi>finis gratia</hi> for the common safety, the people should take part with the <hi>more culpable</hi>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:170314:247"/> side, not as owning their original causes, but as joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them for the common sasety; this maketh not the <hi>people guilty</hi> of the <hi>ill beginning</hi> or <hi>cause</hi> of those they joyn with. <hi>e. g.</hi> As I said before, if the King abuse the Pope or Turk, and they raise War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him for it, the people taking <hi>his</hi> part to prevent the Nations overthrow, do not thereby engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the original of the quarrel, nor become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his fault, nor of any unlawfull War; for they manage it but as <hi>defensive,</hi> against such as would take unjust revenge of the innocent. And so if a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> should somewhat dishonour or abuse a King, (when yet neither of them should go to War for it) the people joyning with the Parliament, are not guilty of that abuse; nor of an unlawfull War, while they interesse themselves only in the business of their own preservation, and not in the original of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.

               <p>If it be said in the fundamental Contracts, that in case the King and Parliament differ, the Subject shall adhere to King against Parliament, or to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against King; then in that case the other loseth his Authority, or rather had but a diminutive part, which might be resisted. But this is a case that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens: For were there such a determination, that one must not be obeyed, they would not enter

               <p>This is most evident from all that is said before, and needeth no more proof. But I suppose some will say here, that <hi>then the case is hard with Kings that have Parliaments to joyn with them in the Soveraign power: for the people must alwayes take part with the Parliament, though they do the wrong, because it is they that are their Trustees and Representatives, and so Kings must ever be at their mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, 1. Where this is the <hi>Constitution,</hi> it is supposed that a King must never fight against his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Parliament: and if he receive the Crown on these termes, he meeteth with nothing but what he consented to; he might have refused it, and may leave it when he will. He must never expect upon any pretence of self-preservation, to have the peoples consent, that he shall have power to destroy them, or make War against them or their Trustees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet <hi>there are cases</hi> in which we all must take part with <hi>a King against a Parliament:</hi> As 1. If they would wrong a King, and depose him unjustly, and

If they <hi>notoriously</hi> betray their trust, not in some tolerable matters, but in the fundamentals, or points that the common good dependeth on, and engage in a cause that would destroy the happiness of the Common-wealth; it is then the peoples duty to forsake them, and cleave to the King against them, if they be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Commonwealth: But this is not to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected till it be notorious. But Parliaments are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible: Should they ever be so corrupt as to seek our ruine, we should not think our selves obliged to obey them or defend them.

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:170314:249"/> for their worldly goods and liberties, at least though for neither, without just Authority and License.</q>
               <p>The Liberties, Goods, and other accommodations of the flesh, which worldlings so much value and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, are dung and dross in comparison of the things of everlasting life. If therefore we may not fight for <hi>Religion,</hi> much less for Liberties or Lives that are contemptible in comparison thereof. It is therefore either confusion and ignorance of the state of the Question, or palpable errour, in them that maintain, that <hi>it is unlawfull to fight for Religion.</hi> It is one thing to fight to <hi>make others Religious,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to fight to <hi>preserve our own Religion,</hi> and to <hi>preserve the meanes of Religion to us and the Nation and our posterity.</hi> They grant themselves what they deny, when they say that we may fight <hi>for our Lives and Liberties:</hi> For though all that fight for their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi> fight not for <hi>their Religion;</hi> yet all that thus fight to preserve <hi>Religion,</hi> do fight for their <hi>Liberties also.</hi> Persecutors will take away our Lives or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if we worship God according to his will, and use the necessary meanes of salvation. In fighting against this persecution, we fight principally and ultimately for our own and posterities salvation, and next for the necessary means thereto, and proximately for our lives and liberties.</p>
               <p>And it is but a delusory course of some in these times, that write many volumes to prove, that <hi>subjects may not bear Arms against their Princes for Religion,</hi> As if those that are against them did think that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion only as the end, yea or life or liberty, would
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:170314:250"/> justifie Rebellion? or that the efficient authorizing Cause were not necessary as well as the final? It's as true that subjects may not fight against their Princes for their Lives or Liberties, as that they may not for Religion.</p>
               <p>There are other things necessary to warrant an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction besides the final Cause. All things are not a means to a good end: nothing can be a means that's <hi>against</hi> the end: but many things may be unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and no just meanes, which by man are intended to the best end. No man may do any thing <hi>against</hi> his <hi>salvation,</hi> nor against the <hi>publike good,</hi> especially in matters of <hi>their</hi> salvation: But yet all is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that men do with an intent to further their own or other mens salvation. Where bearing Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Princes is warrantable <hi>quoad fundamentum,</hi> this will warrant it <hi>quoad finem.</hi> No better <hi>end,</hi> but there must be a good ground also.</p>
               <p>And yet as to the <hi>end,</hi> it is not <hi>every</hi> matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> much less every erroneous conceit of men, that is sufficient. If men that are Equals, yea or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, should think indifferent things to be necessary, or those that are necessary only <hi>ad melius esse,</hi> to be simply necessary; or those that are evil to be good, and hereupon shall force them by fire and sword on other men, they shall answer for their errour, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and cruelty together. If Papists will first believe their fond opinions to be articles of faith, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation, and then will think that the salvation of men, and the publike good dependeth on them, and therefore will propagate them by the sword, or rebell against Princes to maintain them, their errour will not justifie their wickedness. It must be <hi>truly</hi> the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:170314:250"/> cause of God, and the truly necessary meanes of life, and of the common good, and not mistakes or smaller matters, that must be the sufficient end of Warre, even in Princes themselves, that fight for Religion: Much more in people; of which in the next.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 372. In a Christian Commonwealth, where Rulers in their Oaths or Covenants have obliged themselves to maintain the Christian faith, and necessary meanes of the salvation of their people, and have taken the Government on these termes; if after this they break these Covenants, and cast off Christianity, or cast out the meanes of salvation, which they bound themselves to defend, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the body of that Nation to resist them, and defend their welfare: Much more if those that have but part in the Soveraignty, do this.</q>
               <p>Note here 1. That I speak not of an <hi>Infidel Nation,</hi> where the people never make such Covenants with their Princes, but would doubly persecute, were they not restrained: There an Infidel Prince may be a protection and blessing to those few among them that believe. Whereas in a truly Christian Nation, either <hi>no Governour</hi> would be better then a <hi>persecuting Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> (the people associating in Communityes) or at least, they may easily choose a better. 2. I speak not of those Christian States and Nations, that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready promised obedience to known Infidels. But of those that have limited the power of their Princes, in these things: And if the Constitution limit them, their Acceptance of the Government is an implicite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Covenant though there were no more.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:170314:251"/> 3. I say not yet that every private man may resist, but that the body of the Nation in this case may. And the Reason is evident: because 1. They are naturally bound to preserve the common good, especially in the greatest points. 2. And in so doing, it is no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but arbitrary usurpation which they resist. For God giveth Kings no power against himself; and it is here supposed that the People have excepted this power from their Princes: And therefore in this they have no power, and to resist them is to resist no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>And to break the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> the <hi>termes</hi> on which they did <hi>receive</hi> their <hi>Crowns,</hi> is to disoblige the people to whom they Covenanted, and cast away their Crowns, and turn into a state of enmity, if it be <hi>habituate,</hi> and if it be in the <hi>Essentials of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> and especially if they <hi>prosecute</hi> it by a <hi>Warre.</hi> What man can pretend to be so independant, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the God of Heaven, as to have an Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and consequently not from him, which no men may resist. But if the Cause be Gods, and the Prince disabled to oppose it by the Constitution, the case is then most clear.</p>
               <p>Here I shall again annex a Caution, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer some Objections.</p>
               <p>If private men in doubtfull cases will take on them to be judges of their Governors, and conclude them to violate their Covenants, or their Constitution, or the Common safety when it is no such matter, they grievously sin against the Ordinance of God, and the publike Peace. And in case of a private or less publike injury, it is rebellion to make a publike resistance, by raising a warre. A woman may by personall private
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:170314:251"/> resistance defend her Chastity against a King; but she may not raise a warre to defend it. The <hi>Priests</hi> did lawfully <hi>(Azariah with fourscore more valiant men) withstand Ʋzziah the King when he went into the Temple to burn incense; and told him it belonged not to him, and bid him go out of the Sanctuary:</hi> yea when the Leprosie rose upon him, <hi>they thrust him out, 2 Chron.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But if they had raised a warre against him for this, they had done ill.</p>
               <p>And when a people are necessitated to a <hi>defensive warre;</hi> if thy will proceed beyond a <hi>just defence,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>pose their Kings or Governours that have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselves, nor notoriously made themselves uncapable, they will be <hi>Rebels</hi> in deposing them, though their defence was just.</p>
               <p>A Civil warre doth hazzard the happiness of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore is not to be enterprized for any smaller crimes, or for the avoiding of any tolerable evil, but for that which is notoriously more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Nation than the warre it self.</p>
               <p>Indeed where all the Nation agree (as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Jonathan</hi> against <hi>Saul)</hi> or so many that there is no party to make warre against them, then if the King would break his Covenants, or violate their Liberties in a lower case (as <hi>Jonathans</hi> death was) they may as one man say, <hi>This shall not be:</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the execution of the evil, without a warre; yet so that they nevertheless obey and honour the King in all things else.</p>
               <p>And now concerning a Peoples defence of their happiness and safety against a King, that was restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Constitution or his Consent; I must answer some of the Learned <hi>Hadrians Saravia</hi>'s Objections,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:170314:252"/>
                  <hi>de Imperan. author. &amp; Obed. li. 4. cap.</hi> 4. He argueth from the <hi>state of Marriage, 1. That many Covenants about Dowry, Joyntures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be violated, without dissolving the marriage. 2. That the essential condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be violated without such dissolution. 3. That no stipulation can be made that will warrant the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party to separate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these I answer: 1. I grant him, that till a King do actually cast away his Government and become an Enemy, or else habitually make himself incapable or be made so by God, the people may not depart from their subjection. It is not <hi>casting off subjection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in state,</hi> but <hi>resisting in a particular case</hi> that is now in question.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The case of <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Civil Government</hi> so much vary, that the Objection is of no force. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath already stated the power of Husband and Wife, and subjected the Wife to the Husband by his Laws, and that for all alike; so that they are not left at liberty to make any alterations, nor several <hi>Species</hi> of Husbands, as Commonwealths may have several <hi>Species</hi> of Government. God hath not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his Word, whether this or that Nation shall be governed by a Monarch, by the <hi>Optimates,</hi> or by a mixt Government. He hath left it free to them to put the Soveraignty into the hands of one, or two, or an hundred, or a thousand; and to make the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion equall or unequall: much more to limit Rulers in the things that God hath left to their prudentiall determination. 2. Moreover God hath determined that <hi>Marriage</hi> shall be for <hi>life,</hi> and not for a <hi>limited time;</hi> and that it shall not be dissolvable on any terms but those of his description: But he hath not done so
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:170314:252"/> by Governours. He hath no where made it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that Kings shall be for life, and unremoveable: A Dictator for a year, or two year is not forbidden: A King for seven year, is not contrary to Gods Word. If a people that are free, may choose whether they will have a King or none, then may they say, <hi>If you will accept the Crown for seven years, we will subject our selves to you, else not.</hi> If they resolve to have <hi>Kings</hi> by <hi>Rotation</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> had Consuls, that every year or seven year they might have a new one, though I think it not fit, yet it is not against any word of God. And if they may <hi>absolutely</hi> stipulate with them, to <hi>be Kings</hi> but <hi>for such a time,</hi> then may they <hi>conditionally</hi> stipulate to be Kings no longer then <hi>they do so or so. e. g.</hi> To forfeit their Crowns, if they shall raise War against the Nation, or if they introduce a forraign power, or if they set up infidelity, or banish the Gospel, or if they dispossesse the people of their Proprieties. There is liberty for such contracts here, when there is none in Marriage, which God hath not left so much to the will of man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet even in the case of marriage, I deny his conclusion, that <hi>the violation of the essential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions doth not warrant a separation.</hi> He confesseth that <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>wilfull desertion,</hi> are just Causes of divorce: and these are the violations of the essential Conditions. An obstinate perpetuated <hi>negatio congres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> is a <hi>desertion,</hi> His instances of <hi>sterility, morosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>adventitious impotency,</hi> are not instances of a violation of the essential Conditions. A <hi>scold</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth not the essential Conditions and <hi>voluntary ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,</hi> and <hi>impotency</hi> subsequent were never Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted against. <hi>Voluntary self-debilitation</hi> (yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary)
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:170314:253"/> in many Christian States, is allowed as a just cause of Divorce. But if it be not so, yet</p>
               <p n="4">4. The case differeth in this: A Nation <hi>must needs</hi> have Government: But a man or a woman are not in such necessity of marriage: If a Husband be impotent, the woman may lawfully live without his use. But a Nation may not live ungoverned: And therefore if a King fall distracted, or statedly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they must be governed by others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And lastly I answer, That even about Joynture, and Peace and outward Priviledges, though a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may not be divorc't for injury in these, yet hath she her remedy from the Magistrate, who is superiour to her Husband. By your similitude then, you should allow a Nation their remedy, in as great and much greater cases, which yet will not warrant a divorce, or withdrawing of their subjection.</p>
               <p>There is somewhat <hi>in exercitio,</hi> that is essential to Governing; and somewhat that pertaineth but to <hi>better Governing.</hi> As he that <hi>useth</hi> not the former is <hi>no Governour,</hi> so he that is <hi>uncapable</hi> of it, is <hi>uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Governing.</hi> If the <hi>essential qualifications</hi> be wanting, or the <hi>essential conditions</hi> violated, and the <hi>essential ends</hi> be statedly subverted, the <hi>Government is nullified:</hi> Or else the <hi>essence</hi> is <hi>not the essence.</hi> If that part of the happiness of the people be subverted that is <hi>next</hi> to the essential end, they may retain and exercise the power of seeking a due Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>The commonest remedy that Nations have thought meet to use in this case is, to keep all Subjects under the known Laws, and Courts of Justice, that they
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:170314:253"/> may not dare to execute unlawfull Commands, and to restrain Kings from pardoning or defending such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors as do endanger the Nations Rights and Peace: And so to let the Person of the King alone, and to punish the Subjects that break the Laws, though he command them. This is a resisting the Lusts, and the Wills of Princes, but not them, as to their Persons or their Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> thought that some Justice was Essential to a Commonwealth <hi>(Lib. 11. de Civitat. Dei.</hi> cited by a great defender of Kings, <hi>Apolog.</hi> Henrici. 4. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoris in Freher. Vol. 1. pag.</hi> 177.) <hi>[Populum non omnem coetum multitudinis, sed coetum juris consensu &amp; utilitatis communione sociatum esse determinant; &amp; dicunt, tunc esse Rempublicam, id est, rem populi quum benè ac justè geritur, sive ab uno Rege, sive à paucis optimatibus; sive ab universo populo.

               </p>
               <p>To conclude this point: If Princes violating their Covenants, and changing the Constitution, be not to be resisted, then all Princes have equal power, that is, their power is absolute and unlimited as to man:
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:170314:254"/> For then they may all do what they list; which if we tell them, their <hi>list</hi> to exalt their Wills and Interest will be insatiable: And Covenants are vain, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford not the least security for our Peace or Welfare, when <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> the keeping and breaking them is all one. If Princes were sent down from Heaven, or meer Nature produced <hi>Governing Families,</hi> this Doctrine might have some pretence, which now hath none.</p>

               <p>This will engage the Lord to own them, that is the King of Kings, and the disposer of all, in whose favour alone their safety lieth. And this will endear them to all that are good, and cause them to be as zealous in loving and honouring them, as children to

Yea, it will breed much Reverence in the minds of common and ungodly men, who will speak highly of Godliness in a Prince, though they like it not for themselves. And when they see that Princes are Fathers of their Countreys, and seek not themselves, but the common good: it is the most excellent means to procure them common Love and Reverence.</p>

How many are fighting their own warres, arising from the lusts that warre in their members, and making havock of the Church of God? But how few are studious to promote the Gospel, and the union of the Churches, and Peace of Christians, and the Conversion of the unbelieving world! Let them that God enricheth with so great a mercy, value it highly, and take heed of murmuring and ingratitude, or of neglect of those earnest prayers, and cheerfull obedience, by which so great a mercy may be continued and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. How sad a blow was it to <hi>England</hi> that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170314:256"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth was so soon taken away! How many would have after redeemed his life with the dearest price, that before too much undervalued their happiness! One serious thought of the state of most of the Nations of the world, should turn the murmuring humour of too many into hearty Praise, and earnest Prayers to God for our Superiours. If that Nation that is most happy of any upon Earth, in a Government suited to the highest Interest, and to Gods Description, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. 3.) should yet murmure and despise that Government, it would be a most hainous sin, and a terrible, Prognostick, especially to the guilty souls.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the late Warres.</head>
               <p>HAving laid down these fore-going Grounds, it would not be here unseasonable to render a publick account of my own actions, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that Question, which I have been urged with by so many, <hi>[By what Reasons was I moved to engage my self in the Parliaments Warre?]</hi> But (though I have not leisure to render so full an account to each particular Quaerist, as may be satisfactory, and therefore could be content to dispatch it here at once for all, yet) it will require so long a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of my own affairs, and also so many ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full recitals of the abuses and evils of those times, that I shall not undertake so unpleasant a task, till I am called to it by such necessity, as will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse these inconveniences: but only cursorily shall cast in these following brief accounts instead of a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Declaration.</p>
               <p>§. I. The malignant hatred of seriousness in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, did work so violently in the rabble where I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that I could not stay at home with any probable safety of my life. My life was sought before I went away: Sober, pious men of Neighbour-Parishes, that thought the rabble had been upon my head in a
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:170314:257"/> tumult (when indeed I was out of Town) were knockt down in the streets, to the hazzard of their lives, when they went among them to look after me; and meerly because they were accounted Puritans. And all this was but on a false rumour, that the Churchwardens were about to obey the Parliaments Order, in taking down the Images of the Trinity about the Church. The Warre was begun in our streets before the King or Parliament had any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The hatred of the Puritans, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Reformation, inflamed the ignorant, drunken, and ungodly rout, so that I was forced to be gone even before the Warres; but when I returned, and the Armies came among us, I could then stay no longer; nor had I any place of safety from their rage, but the Armies and Garrisons of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And multitudes of my Neighbours as well as I, were forced into Garisons to save their lives, that else would have lived at home in peace. And I only propose it, Whether those Subjects, that are utterly undeservedly deprived of the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Magistrates and Laws, are not discharged of their obligations, and turned out of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, and are put to seek for other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours?</p>
               <p>§. II. A Parliament (as farre as I have been able to learn) hath all these four or five capacities 1. It is a Representative of the People as free. 2. It Representeth the People as Subjects. 3. By the Constitution they have part in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. 4. They are the Kings chief Councel. 5. And they are the Kings chief Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature.</p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:170314:258"/>
               <p>Of the Antiquity of their Power, and its Extent, I referre you to Mr. <hi>Bacons</hi> Treatise of Parliaments, and Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>'s Book of the Power and Priviledges of Parliaments (to pass by others.) But it is no way necessary to the cause in hand to <hi>prove</hi> the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of their <hi>Being,</hi> or their <hi>Power.</hi> When ever they were established in that <hi>Power,</hi> it was by an <hi>Explicite</hi> or <hi>Implicite Contract,</hi> between the Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there being no other Ground that can bear them, except an immediate Divine Institution, which none pretend to. And the Prince and People have as much power in <hi>this Age</hi> to make such a Contract, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Constitution, as they had three thousand years ago. And therefore if I find them in <hi>possession</hi> of the <hi>Power,</hi> and can prove but a <hi>Mutual Consent</hi> of Prince and People, I need no other proof of their Power.</p>
               <p>§. III. When I say that the Parliament Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth the People as <hi>free,</hi> I take it for undeniable, that the Government is <hi>constituted</hi> by <hi>Contract,</hi> and that in the <hi>Contract,</hi> the People have not <hi>Absolutely</hi> subjected themselves to the Soveraign, without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving any Rights or Liberties</hi> to themselves; but that some <hi>Rights</hi> are reserved by them, and exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Princes power: And therefore that the <hi>Parliament</hi> are their <hi>Trustees</hi> for the securing of <hi>those exempted Rights,</hi> and so <hi>Represent the People as free;</hi> not as <hi>wholly free,</hi> but as being <hi>so farre free</hi> as that exemption signifies. The <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> as a <hi>People,</hi> are in order of nature before the <hi>Constitution,</hi> and excepted, and so established and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <hi>in it.</hi> And this is the first Capacity of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:170314:258"/>
                  <hi>To Represent the People as a People, to secure their Liberties as Trustees:</hi> If any man deny them this Capacity, he makes us <hi>absolutely subject</hi> to an <hi>unlimited arbitrary power,</hi> contrary to all Law, and our long possessions, and to all reason. <hi>To have no Rights, and to have none but what are wholly at the Princes will, and which we have no security for,</hi> is in effect all one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Parliament as they <hi>Represent the People as Subjects,</hi> can do nothing but humbly manifest their grievances, and Petition for Relief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Parliament as having part in <hi>the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Constitution,</hi> hath part in the Legislative power, and in the final Judgement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it is the Kings chief Councel, he is ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear them in cases that concern the safety and Peace of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As it is his highest Court of Justice, they have power of judgement and execution, over all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; so that from them there is no Appeal: The King being to judge by his Judges in their several Courts, this is his highest Judicature; yet so as that the Power of Judging was not equally in both Houses.</p>
               <p>The Disputers that oppose the Parliaments Cause, do commonly go on false suppositions, about the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Being and Power of Parliaments, and take it for granted, <hi>[That the</hi> Soveraign <hi>Power was only in the King, and so that it was an Absolute Monarchy, and not a mixture of Monarchy, Aristocracy and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy; and that the Parliament had but the proposing of Laws, and that they were enacted only by the Kings Authority, upon their Request, and so that the Power
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:170314:259"/> of Armes, and of Warre, and Peace, was in the King alone; and therefore they conclude, That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being Subjects may not take up A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mes without him, and that it is Rebellion to resist him; and most of this they gather from the Oath of Supremacy, and from the Parliaments calling themselves his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their Grounds are sandy, and their Superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture false, as I shall manifest.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Oath of Supremacy secureth the Kings Title against all forrain claim, either of the Pope or any other, and consequently against all home-bred Usurpers: But the Name of <hi>Supream,</hi> or <hi>Soveraign,</hi> given peculiarly to the King, is no sufficient discovery of the constitution of the Commonwealth, nor any proof that it is an absolute Monarchy, and not a mixt Government, and that the soveraign Power is wholly in him: When the contrary is known in the Constitution, the <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> is no disproof. It's usual to honour the Prince with the Title of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> (for divers weighty Reasons) when yet the Senate or Nobles have a part in the soveraign Power. Such Oathes therefore bind us only to acknowledge the Kings Soveraignty as it is in the constitution, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Power of the Parliament, and they cannot be interpreted to be against the Constitution: Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Lawyers commonly warn us to take heed of judging of the Power in the Commonwealth by meer Titles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Parliament</hi> are <hi>Subjects</hi> is confessed; but as they are <hi>Subjects</hi> in <hi>one capacity,</hi> (both in their personal private states, and as the Representative of the <hi>Subjects as such)</hi> so have they part in the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:170314:259"/> also, in their <hi>higher capacity,</hi> by the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as shall be proved. The same Persons may have part in the Soveraignty, that in other respects are Subjects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some go further, and would prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the full Soveraignty of the King, as from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, &amp;c. As if the <hi>Species</hi> of Government were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally determined of in Scripture; and so all forms of Government made unlawfull, except absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. If they could prove this, they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch many Controversies in Christian States about their Constitutions, and all must be reduced to one form: But there is nothing in Scripture against other forms, but somewhat for a mixt Government in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> God hath not told us whether <hi>England</hi> and all other Nations shall be Governed by One or Two, or four Hundred: but <hi>where the King is the Supream,</hi> it is the will of God that the people should obey him, which is all that <hi>Peter</hi> requireth. The <hi>Romans</hi> hated the Name of a King: It was neither the intent of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> here, or of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. to determine whether the Emperour or the Senate were Supream: much less to determine that Kings must have the full Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through the world.</p>
               <p>This folly possesseth the Democratical party also, (that call themselves Commonwealths men:) they imagine that God himself hath given the Soveraign Power to the people; and consequently that no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but Popular is lawfull. Whereas it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that God hath not tyed the Nations of the world to Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy, or any one form, but left that free to their own choice, under the Direction of his general Rules, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:170314:260"/> of his Providential disposals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the Objecters Grounds are manifestly rotten, so that their superstructure is unsound, and that indeed the Parliament hath a part in the Suprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, I shall undeniably prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Legislation is the most principal eminent part of the Soveraigns Right: But Legislation belonged to the two Houses of Parliament as well as to the King: therefore the Right of Soveraignty belonged to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in part, as well as to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Legislative Power, is not only essential to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, but is the <hi>one half</hi> of its essence, and the first and chiefest part. He that denyeth this renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Policy and Reason. But that the Parliament had a part in the Legislative power, (even of <hi>Enacting,</hi> and not only of <hi>proposing,)</hi> is undoubted. I will not run to Records, or to Writers for proof, because here a contradicting wit may find some work; but I will give you two proofs, that nothing but immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty can contradict. The first is, Common Experience <hi>de facto.</hi> Parliaments do make Laws: the King was sworn to Govern by those Laws, <hi>quas vulgus elegerit:</hi> the Lawes expresly speak their Authors, <hi>[Be it Enacted by the Authority of Parliament]</hi> or <hi>[by the Kings Majesty, and the Lords, and Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Assembled,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not <hi>[upon their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Proposal]</hi> only, but <hi>[by them]</hi> or <hi>[by their Authority.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The King himself (by the advice of his delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Council in the time of his separation from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) doth confess as much as I desire: 1. That the Government of <hi>England</hi> is mixt of Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy. 2. That it is not an
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:170314:260"/> Absolute Monarchy. 3. That the Ballance must hang even between the three Estates. 4. That the King, the Lords, and the Commons, are these three Estates. 5. That the Laws are made in <hi>England</hi> by a King, by a House of Peers, and by a House of Commons chosen by the people joyntly. 6. That the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are an excellent Conserver of the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. 7. That they are solely entrusted with the first Propositions concerning the Levies of Monies, the sinews of Peace and Warre; and the Impeaching of those that violate the Law. 8. That the King is bound to protect the Law. 9. That he may not make use of his power to the hurt of those for whose good he hath it. 10. That the Commons are to Advise him for the Protection of the Law. 11. That the Lords are trusted with a power of Judicature. 12. That they are a Screen or Bank between the Prince and people, to assist each against the Encroachments of the other and by just Judgement to preserve the Law, which ought to be the Rule of every one of the Three. 13. That the Parliament have a Legal power, more than sufficient to restrain the power of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 14. That the encroaching of one of these Estates upon the others power, is unhappy in the effects to all.] All this you shall have in the Kings own words in his Answer to the Parliaments 19 Propositions.</p>
               <p>[There being three kinds of Government, Absolute Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy; and in all these their particular conveniences and inconveniences; the experience and wisdome of your Ancestours hath moulded this out of a mixture of these, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of all three, without the inconveniences of any one, as long as the Ballance hangs even between the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:170314:261"/> three Estates; and in their proper channell (begetting verdure and fertility in the meddows on both sides,) and then overflowing of either on either side, raised no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge or inundation: The ill of Absolute Monarchy is Tyranny: The ill of Aristocracy is Faction, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision: the ills of Democracy are Tumults, Violence, and Licentiousness. The good of Monarchy is the Ʋniting of a Nation under one Head; to resist Invasion from abroad, and Insurrection at home. The good of Aristocracy is the conjunction of Councils in the ablest Persons of a State for the publique benefit: The good of Democracy is Liberty, nad the courage and industry which Liberty begets.</p>
               <p>In this Kingdome <hi>the Laws are joyntly made</hi> by a King, by a House of Peers, and by a House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons chosen by the People, all having free Votes, and particular Priviledges; the Government of these Laws are intrusted to the King; Power of Treaties of War and Peace, of making Peers, of choosing Officers and Counsellors of State, Judges for Law, Commanders for Forts and Castles, giving Commissions for raising men to make Warre abroad, or to prevent or provide against Invasions or Insurrections at home, Benefit of Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, power of pardoning, and some more of the like kind are placed in the King. And this kind of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monarchy having the power to preserve that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without which it would be disabled to preserve the Laws in their force, and the Subjects in their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is intended to draw to him such a respect and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the great ones as may hinder the ills of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Faction, and such a fear and reverence from the people; as may hinder tumults, violence, and licentiousnes. Again, that the Prince may not make use of this high,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:170314:261"/> and perpetual power, to the hurt of those for whose good he hath it, and make use of the name of publick necessity for the gain of his private Favorites and Followers, the House of Commons (an excellent Conserver of Liberty, but never intended for any share in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or the choosing of them that <note place="margin">He meaneth the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part.</note> should Govern) is solely intrusted with the first Propositions, concerning the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies of Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>s (the sinews of Peace and War) and the impeaching of those, who for their own ends have violated that Law, which he is bound to protect, and to the protection of which they were bound to advise him. And the Lords being trusted with a Judicature power, are an excellent Screen or Bank, between the Prince and People, to assist each against the Encroachments of the other, and by just Judgements to preserve that Law which ought to be the Rule of every one of the three—since therefore the Legal power in Parliaments is more than sufficient to restrain the power of Tyrannie—since the encroaching of one of these Estates upon the power of the other, is unhappy in the effect to all.]</p>
               <p>You see here all the Parliaments capacities acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: 1. That the Commons are chosen by the people, as Trustees for their Liberties, (and that they represent them as Subjects none deny.) 2. That they are the Kings Advisers. 3 That the Lords have the power of Judicature, as the Commons of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. That the Legislative power, (that is, the Soveraignty) is joyntly in King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as three Estates; and so that the Government is mixt of Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy. And thus far we are agreed of the Constitution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if it were not thus confessed, we might
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:170314:262"/> prove the Parliaments interest in the Supremacy, by some Judicial Instances, with the restraints of the King; (but that it's needless to debate a confessed thing.) <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <hi>de Imperio summar.

               <p>§. IV. I was satisfied by Reason, and consent of Lawyers, even those that are most zealous for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and most judicious, that in many Cases a King may be resisted: I will Instance these following out of <hi>Grotius</hi> (and <hi>Barclay,</hi> with whom in divers of them he consents, and adds the rest:) <hi>de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, li. 1. c. 4. pag.</hi> 86, 87, 90, 91. which I will not so much as translate, that none may suspect me to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the words by the translation, or to tempt the vulgar to misunderstand them.</p>

               <p>You see here divers Cases in which Resisting is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. In general, it's lawfull for them that have part in the Soveraignty, to defend their part: and it's lawfull for the people to defend their Liberties; in points exempted from the Princes Power: (but this must be with the exceptions, limitations and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I have before expres't.)</p>
               <p>§. V. The Laws in <hi>England</hi> are above the King: Because they are not his Acts alone, but the Acts of King and Parliament conjunctly, who have the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative (that is, the Soveraign) Power. This is confessed by the King in the forecited Answer to the 19 Propositions.</p>
               <p>§. VI. The King was to execute Judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Laws, by his Judges in his Courts of Justice: and his Parliament was his highest Court
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:170314:264"/> (as is said) where his personal will and word was not of sufficient Authority to suspend or cross the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court, except in some particular cases submitted to him.</p>
               <p>§. VII. The peoples Rights were evidently inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Ship-money, and other impositions were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, and so without authority: The new Oath imposed by the Convocation, and the King: the ejecting and punishing Ministers for not reading the Books for Sports on the Lords Daies, for not bowing towards the Altar, for preaching Lectures, and twice on the Lords Day, with many the like, were without Law, and so without authority. If Bishops <hi>jure Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastico</hi> might have commanded them, yet could they not lay any corporal penalties or mulcts for them, nor should any man have lost his temporal live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood or liberty, which Ecclesiasticks have no power over. Many thousands have suffered, or been forced to remove out of the Land, upon the account of illegal impositions.</p>
               <p>§. VIII. The Parliament did Remonstrate to the Kingdom, the danger of the subversion of Religion, and Liberties, and of the common good and interest of the people, whose Trustees they were. And we were obliged to believe them both as the most compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Witnesses and Judges, and the chosen Trustees of our Liberties. We are our selves uncapable of a full discovery of such dangers till it be too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy them: And therefore the constitution of the Government having made the Parliament the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees of our Liberties, hath made them our eyes by
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:170314:265"/> which we must discern our dangers. Or else they had been useless to us.</p>
               <p>§. IX. The former proceedings afforded us so much experience as made the Parliaments Remonsirance credible. We had newly seen a general endeavour to change the face of things among us. Many new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church; abundance of the most painfull Preachers (though peaceable) cast out: Abundance of ignorant, idle, scandalous Readers kept in; and practical serious godliness made the common scorn, though found in the conformable to all the legal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I will forbear to rake any further into those calamities. Only I shall say, that I suppose my Reader to have been acquainted with those times, and with the course of the High Commission, and the Bishops Courts, and to have read the Articles in Parliament against Bishop <hi>Land,</hi> Bishop <hi>Goodman,</hi> Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> Bishop <hi>Pierce,</hi> &amp;c. and the charge against the Judges about Ship money; and Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Centuries: and Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>'s Introduction, or Works of Darkness brought to Light; and his <hi>Canterburies</hi> Tryal, and his Popish Royal Favorite, and his <hi>Romes</hi> Master piece; and especially the sworn Articles of the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Match.</p>
               <p>§. X. It was time for us to believe a Parliament concerning our danger and theirs, when we heard so many impious persons rage against them; and when the Army then in the North was (by the confession of the chief Officers) about to have been drawn up towards <hi>London;</hi> to what end is easie to conjecture: when so many Delinquents were engaged &amp; enraged
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:170314:265"/> against them, who all took refuge with the King. And when we say the odious Irish Rebellion broke forth, and so many thousand barbarously murdered; no less (by credible testimony) then an hundred and fifty thousand murdered in the one Province of <hi>Ʋl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> only: I suppose him that I dispute with to have read the Examinations by the Irish Justices, and Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Persecution of the Church in <hi>Ireland:</hi> else he is incompetent for the debate. If you say, <hi>What was all this to</hi> England? I Answer, We knew how great a progress the same party had made in <hi>England,</hi> and it was them that we were told by the Trustees of our safety, that we were in danger of, and the fire was too near us to be neglected; and our safety too much threatned, to be carelesly ventured in the heat of the peril; or to be wholly taken out of our Trustees hands, when thousands were thus suddenly butchered by the Papists in our own Dominions, and those Papists likely to have invaded <hi>England,</hi> when they had conquered <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their Friends were so powerfull about the Court, &amp; through the Land, and the Parliament hated by them for opposing their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts (the Irish professing to raise Arms for the King, to defend his Prerogative &amp; their own Religion against our Parliament) I say, in such a time as this, we had reason to believe our entrusted Watchmen, that told us of the danger, &amp; no reason to suffer our lives and liberties to be taken out of their Trust &amp; wholly put into the hands of the King. We had rather of the two be put upon the inconvenience of justifying our defence, then to have been butchered by thousands, or fall into such hands as <hi>Ireland</hi> did: For then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining would have been vain. It would not have
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:170314:266"/> made dead men alive, nor recovered <hi>England</hi> out of their hands, for the survivers to have accused them of perfidiousness or cruelty. It was then no time to discredit our Watchmen.</p>
               <p>§. XI. We saw the King raise Forces against the Parliament, having forsaken them, and first sought to feize upon their Members, in a way which he confest a breach of their priviledge.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The Tumults at</hi> Westminster <hi>drove him away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Only by <hi>displeasing him;</hi> not by <hi>endangering him,</hi> or <hi>medling with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The Parliament was not free by reason of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Parliament knew best when they were free. If the major part had thought so, why did they not Vote against those tumults, and forbid, and bring the rude Petitioners to Justice? The disorders on both sides among the tumultuary, were unexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but no just cause to cast the Nation into a Warre. A Prince may not raise War against his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Apprentices shew some rudeness in their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the Parliament began the War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> For my part, I am satisfied of the contrary: but the cause dependeth not on that. And the debate is not easily managed to satisfaction on either side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we agree not what was the beginning of the Warre. If the Apprentices tumultuous petitioning were a Warre, then it was begun long before on the other side, when the Army was to have been drawn up towards <hi>London,</hi> and by other waies; as when the King set a Guard on them against their wills, when the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> raised Forces near the City; and the King
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:170314:266"/> afterward in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> the Parliament had no Army: so that if actual raising force was the beginning of the Warre, it seems he begun. But yet he saith, <hi>Their Commissions were dated before his.</hi> It may be so: (I knew nothing of that.) But Forces may be raised before they have any written Commissions. It was long before that the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> wrote to him to withdraw into a place of safety, to these ends which he pursued. If you say, that <hi>those began the War that gave the first occasion;</hi> 1. We must follow that so high as will make the discovery difficult, and the debate irksome. 2. And when we have done, no doubt (as in most fallings out) we shall find that both sides were too blame, though not <hi>equally</hi> too blame.</p>
               <p>§. XII. All the Kings Counsellours and Souldiers were <hi>Subjects,</hi> and legally under the Power of the Parliament. They had Power to try and <hi>Subject,</hi> and judge them to punishment for their crimes. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors whom they would have judged, fled from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to the King, and there defended themselves by force.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the Parliament would have injured them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Who should be Judge of that, if not the Supream Court of Justice? The Laws are above the King.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Parliaments Souldiers were Subjects of the King, as well as the Kings Souldiers to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True: but if Subjects break the Laws, the King is to judge them by his Courts of Justice, and so the King can do no wrong.</p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:170314:267"/>
               <p>§. XIII. If inferiour Courts of Justice may prosecute the execution of their sentences, in several cases a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Kings Will, and the Sheriff may raise the Power of the County to assist that execution, much more may the Highest Court do thus: But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is commonly acknowledged to be true: Therefore.</p>
               <p>§. XIV. The Parliament did not raise War against the <hi>Person or Authority of the King;</hi> nor did I ever serve them on any such account: But their cause was, 1. To defend themselves and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth from evil Subjects, that flying from Justice, had made up an Army by the Kings consent. 2. To bring Offenders to a Legal Trial. 3. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to Defend themselves against the Kings mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided <hi>Will.</hi> So that their War was directly against Subjects, but remotely against the <hi>Will</hi> of the King, but not against his <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Person.</hi> And Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cease not to be Subjects, when they get into an Army, and procure his consent to their illegal enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. Unless every one of his Souldiers was a King, or some of them at least, I know not that I ever fought against the King. Nor really do I believe that every man is against him, that is against a <hi>Subject</hi> that hath <hi>His</hi> Commission, when by the Law which is <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Commission</hi> of the King, he is a <hi>Subject still,</hi> and answerable for his offences.</p>
               <p>That it was Subjects that the War was raised against, and not the King, appeareth, 1. In all the Parliaments Declarations of their Cause (though his misdoings they alledge as the occasion of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.)
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:170314:267"/> 2. In their Commissions to their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. All that ever I saw were for <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Yea it was the common word of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, if they were asked, <hi>Who they were for?</hi> to say <hi>[For King and Parliament.]</hi> 3. We had two <hi>Protestations,</hi> and a <hi>Solemne League and Covenant</hi> imposed on the Nation, to be for <hi>King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And if <hi>Declarations, Professions, Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>National Oaths and Covenants</hi> will not tell us, what the <hi>Cause of the War was,</hi> then there is no discovery. I refer the Reader that would know the Parliaments Cause, to their <hi>Remonstrance of the state of the Kingdom;</hi> and <hi>A Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the Grounds and Reasons, that necessitate them at this time to take up Defensive Armes, for the Preservation of his Majesties Person, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the true Religion, the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdome, and the Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament.</hi> August 3. 1642.] These fully tell you the Parliaments Cause, being their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it.</p>
               <p>§. XV. When the Parliament commanded us to obey them, and not Resist them, I knew not how to Resist and disobey them, without violation of the Command of God, <hi>Rom. 13. Let every soul be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Power,</hi> &amp;c. And without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the danger of the Condemnation there threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Resisters. I think none doubts but that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obliged Christians to obey the Senate as well as the Emperour. When it was confessed by the King, that the Legislative Power was in the three Estates
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:170314:268"/> conjunct, and the State was Mixt, and conseqently that the Parliament had a part in the Soveraignty, I thought it Treason to Resist them, as the Enemy did, apparently in order to their subversion, and unlawfull to disobey their just Commands, such as I thought these were.</p>
               <p>§. XVI. When the Subjects were in doubt of the sense of the Law, (into which most of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie was resolved) I took the Parliament to be <hi>the Highest Interpreter of Lawes that was then existent in the Division.</hi> And therefore that it was Law to us, which they declared to be Law, so it were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and clearly against our own Knowledge, or against that truth which in our callings we might well attain the Knowledge of. I knew no higher Judge of the Law then to appeal to. If in case of Ship-money the Judges of inferiour Courts did satisfie the King, then in case of the safety or danger of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, I thought the Judgment of the highest Court should satisfie me.</p>
               <p>§. XVII. I had great reason to believe, that if the King had conquered a Parliament, <hi>The Nation had lost all security of their Liberties, and been at his Mercy,</hi> and not only under his Government: and that Warre is an act of Hostility: and that if he had conquered them by such persons as he then imployed, it had not been in his power to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Commonwealth if he would: His impious and popish Armies would have ruled him, and used him as other Armies have done those that entrusted them. And therefore when <hi>Ireland</hi> was so used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:170314:268"/> our eyes, and the Papists there so strong, and the Queens, and the Earl of <hi>New-castles</hi> forces (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides others) so many of them Papists, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers of the King were commonly known, where ever they came, by horrid Oaths and Curses, being called <hi>Damn-me's,</hi> because <hi>[God damn me]</hi> was their common word, and when a man was used by them as a Traitor, that was but noted for a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, or was heard to read the Scripture, or to sing a Psalm in his Family; I say, when these were they that were imployed to conquer us, I knew that the safety of the Commonwealth lay in resisting them, and that they could have conquered the King, when they had conquered us.</p>
               <p>§. XVIII. I had sufficient ground from what is cited before from <hi>Grotius</hi> (and more such like) to conclude that the Parliament having a part in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, might defend their part against any that invaded it: and exercise it upon any Subject. And that their part was invaded, the fore-mentioned evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, with what is in their Remonstrances shew: And the very intermission and almost extinction of Parliaments sheweth it yet more. The King was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Calling of Parliaments, on suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that called they must be: The <hi>seasonableness</hi> which he was entrusted with, was but a circumstance; and if under pretence of <hi>seasonable calling them,</hi> he will <hi>call none,</hi> or to <hi>no purpose,</hi> or break them up before they can do the work to which they were appointed, this is but to betray the trust of the Commonwealth. Parliaments by Law were to be held yearly, and say some, before the Conquest
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:170314:269"/> twice a year. See <hi>An. 36. E. 3, &amp; 4. E. 3. Et in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leges</hi> Edgar. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. Cook <hi>Institut. part</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 7. (Of their Honour and Antiquity, see Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Cook Instit. Part 1. Sect. 164. &amp; Praefat. lib.</hi> 9. Of Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>&amp; 7. H.</hi> 6.) They that trusted the King to call a Parliament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expressed that they were to be called, &amp; it was not in his power to extinguish them, by not calling them.</p>
               <p>§. XIX. I knew, that as the Parliament was the Representative Body of the People of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who are the subject of the Common Good, so that the Common Good is the Essential End of Government, and therefore that it cannot be a just War that by their King is made against them (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the fore-excepted Cases: And that the end being more excellent than the means, is to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, and no means to stand in competition with the End. And therefore if I had known that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had been the beginners, and in most fault, yet the ruine of our <hi>Trustees</hi> and <hi>Representatives,</hi> and so of all the <hi>Security</hi> of the Nation, is a <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment greater,</hi> than any fault of theirs against a King can from him deserve; and that their faults cannot disoblige me from defending the Commonwealth. I owned not all that ever they did; but I took it to be my duty to look to the main end. And I knew that the King had all his Power for the Common Good, and therefore had none against it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that no Cause can warrant him to make the Commonwealth the party, which he shall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Hostility against. And that War against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (especially by such an Army, in such a Cause)
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:170314:269"/> is Hostility against them, and so against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; all this seemed plain to me. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I knew how things went before, and who were the Agents, and how they were minded, and what were their purposes against the people.</p>
               <p>§. XX. When I found so many things Conjunct, as <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>three Estates</hi> against the <hi>Will</hi> of the King alone; the Kingdoms Representative and Trustees assaulted in the guarding of our Liberties, and the highest Court defending themselves against <hi>offending Subjects,</hi> and seeking to bring them to a Legal Tryal, and the Kingdoms safety, and the Common Good involved in their Cause (which may be more fully manifested, but that I would not stir too much in the evils of times past.) All these, and many more concurring, perswaded me, that it was <hi>sinfull to be Neutrals,</hi> and <hi>Treacherous to be against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Cause.</hi> These were my apprehensions, and on such grounds as these here briefly hinted. And it somewhat moved me to see what the Parties on both sides were, of whom I will now say no more, but that it were a wonder if so many humble honest Christians, fearfull of sinning, and praying for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, should be all mistaken in so weighty a case, and so many <hi>Dam me's</hi> all in the right. But yet this was not the <hi>Rule</hi> I went by, but <hi>some Motive</hi> on the by.</p>
               <p>So that the Cause of the Parliament which they engaged us to defend, 1. Was not the Sovereign Power of the People, as above the King, and the Original of Authority; as if the State of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth had been Democratical. 2. Nor was it
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:170314:270"/> to procure a change of the Constitution, and to take down Royaltie, and the House of Lords, but clean contrary, it was the Defence of the old Constitution against the changes which they affirmed were attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted. 3. Nor was it the altering of Laws, which is not to be done by force, but freely by the Law-givers. And therefore it was not to procure a cessation of the Magistrates Power in Religion, for encouraging well-doers, and restraining intollerable Deceivers, which some call <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> 4. Nor was it to offer any violence to the Person of the King; but to rescue him from them that had seduced him into a War against his Parliament, to his peril. These were the Grounds that we were engaged on, and I knew no other.</p>
               <p>And therefore whereas some Pamphlets now flie abroad, that would defame the Parliament and their Adherents, as having engaged in a Treasonable Cause, and make that Cause to have been, 1. The <hi>Changing</hi> of the Government into <hi>Popular.</hi> 2. Or the Defence of it as <hi>Popular already,</hi> as if the <hi>People</hi> had been the <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi> 3. The deposing or destroying of the King. 4. The vindicating of an illegal or unlimited exemption from the Magistrates Power in matters of Religion, which they call, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Liberty;</hi> these need no further confutation then the reading of the <hi>Parliaments Remonstrance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration aforesaid,</hi> and the rest of their published Professions, and Oaths, and Covenants. The clean contrary to these they openly professed: As, 1. That King, Lords and Commons in Parliament were the Legislators, and so had highest power. 2. That it was the Peoples Proprieties and Liberties,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:170314:270"/> (and not their personal Sovereignty) that they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 3. That it was the <hi>Defence</hi> and not the <hi>destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Laws that they endeavoured. And, 4. That it was former <hi>connivance at Popery</hi> that they were offended at, and not a <hi>Liberty for Popery</hi> that they fought for; and that <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> were <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted</hi> against by them, is well known; though the Liberty of Truth and Godliness they defended. And, 5. That they intended no hurt, but preservation to the King. This was their <hi>professed Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know <hi>Grotius</hi> in the fore-cited passages goeth higher, That a King may lose his own part in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty in a War, in which he invadeth the part of those that had a share with him: And I know that he concludeth that Hostility is inconsistent with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that other Learned <hi>Politicians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That if a King will make himself the Enemy of the People, and engage in War against them; he deposeth himself, and may be used by them as an Enemy.</hi> But these things belong not to the <hi>Old Cause</hi> of the Parliament; nor, for my own part, have I ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed my self in any such Cause, and therefore am not to be accountable for it. Every man must answer for himself. It is only that <hi>Old Cause</hi> that I have been engaged in. And many things that since have been done, my soul lamenteth and disclaimeth.</p>
               <p>Yet must I add, That though I own not all the ways of men, that have had a hand in our Changes, 1. I am confident that these that have been cast down, had great cause to acknowledge the Justice of God against them, especially for their encouraging the scorn of Holiness through the Land, and the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of multitudes fearing God, which the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:170314:271"/> God would not put up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That I am bound to submit to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as set over us by God, and to obey for Conscience sake, and to behave my self as a Loyal Subject towards them. For, 1. A full and free Parliament hath owned it, and so there is notoriously the <hi>Consent of the People,</hi> which is the evidence that former Princes had to justifie their best Titles. They that plead Inheritance and Law, must fetch the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from <hi>Consent</hi> (Though, as I have shewed before, that <hi>Consent</hi> doth but <hi>specifie,</hi> and then <hi>design the Persons,</hi> on whom <hi>God himself</hi> doth confer the Power.)</p>
               <p>When <hi>Grotius</hi> questioneth even <hi>invasores Imperii (De Jure belli. lib. 1. pag.</hi> 91.) he excepteth from any Question the Case, 1. <hi>Postquam long a possessione. 2. Aut Pacto, jus nactus est invasor;</hi> and even of others, he acknowledgeth some obligation to obey them. And <hi>ib. cap. 4. pag.</hi> 93. §. 20. he giveth that safe and general Rule, which such as I that are private men, and not made Judges of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Title of Princes must be guided by, and which <hi>Paul</hi> commended, it seemeth to the Christians in his times, yea and before him, Christ himself <hi>[Maxime autem in re controversà judicium sibi privatus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere non debet, sed p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I have made this Confession to the world of my former actions, and the reason of them, 1. At once to satisfie the Many that demand satisfaction. 2. That if I have erred, I may not die without Repentance, but may be recovered by their advice.</p>
               <p>And therefore I will further confess how I stand affected to these actions in the review, 1. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of War, and the evils that attend and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, hath made me hate it incomparably more than I did before I tried or knew it: and the name of Peace, much more the Thing, is now exceeding amiable to me. 2. I unfeignedly believe that both Parties were too blame in the late Wars: The one Party in the things forementioned: and the other in too impatient undergoings <note place="margin">Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I think that all of us did rush too eagerly into the heat of Divisions and War, and none of us did so much as we should have done to prevent it: And, though I was in no capacity to have done much, yet I unfeignedly Repent that I did no more for Peace in my place, then I did, and that I did not pray more hearti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Contention and War before it came, and spake no more against it than I did; and that I spoke so much to blow the Coals. For this I daily beg for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of the Lord, through the precious blood of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:170314:272"/> the great Reconciler. 4. The hatred of Strife and War, and love of Peace, and observation of the lamentable miscarriages since, have called me oft to search my heart, and try my ways by the Word of God, Whether I did lawfully engage in that War or not? (which I was confident then was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est outward service that ever I performed to God:) And whether I lawfully encouraged so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands to it? And the issue of all my search is this, and never was any other but this, 1. The case of blood being a thing so dreadfull, and some wise and good men being against me, and many of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments being plausible, and my understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak, I shall continue with self-suspition to search, and be glad of any information that may convince me, if I have been mistaken; and I make it my daily earnest prayer to God, that he will not suffer me to live or die impenitently, or without the discovery of my sin, if I have sinned in this matter: And could I be convinced of it, I would as gladly make a publick Recantation, as I would eat or drink: And I think I can say, that I am truly willing to know the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet I cannot see that I was mistaken in the main Cause, nor dare I repent of it, nor forbear the same, if it were to do again in the same slate of things. I should do all I could to prevent such a War; but if it could not be prevented, I must take the same side as then I did. And my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tells me, That if I should do otherwise I should be guilty of Treason or Disloyaltie against the Sovereign Power of the Land, and of perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness to the Commonwealth, and of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:170314:272"/> offending Subjects before the Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and the Will of the King above that safety of the Commonwealth, and consequently above his own welfare; and that I should be guilty of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up the Land to blood (as <hi>Ireland</hi> was) or too much worse, under pretence of avoiding blood, in a necessary defence of all that is dear to us.</p>
               <p>And it were too great folly, by <hi>following acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> that were then unknown, for me to judge of the <hi>former Cause.</hi> That which is calamitous in the event, is not alway sinfull in the enterprise. Should the change of times make me forget the state that we were formerly in, and change my judgement by losing the sense of what then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its information, this <hi>folly and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> would be the way to a <hi>sinfull.</hi> and not to an <hi>obedient</hi> Repentance. Nor can I be so unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as to say, for all the sinnes and miscarriages of men since, that we have not received much mercy from the Lord: When Godliness was the common scorn, the prejudice and shame most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably prevailed to keep men from it, and so encouraged them in wickedness: But through the great mercy of God, many thousands have been converted to a holy upright life, proportionably more than were before, since the reproach did cease, and the prejudice was removed, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preachers took the places of scandalous ones, or ignorant Readers. When I look upon the place where I live, and see that the Families of the ungodly, are here one, and there one in a Street, as the Families of the godly were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:170314:273"/> (though my own endeavours have been too weak and cold) it forceth me to set up the Stone of Remembrance, and to say, <hi>[HITHERTO HATH THE LORD HELPED ƲS.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I must say (to prevent the Cavills of malicious Readers,) That though I have here laid down the Grounds upon which I think my E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gagement in the late War to have been justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, yet I intend not that every one of these distinctly, is a sufficient <hi>Medium</hi> to inferre the Conclusion: But all together shew you on what Grounds I shall proceed with any man that will ingenuously dispute the Point. I must profess, that if I had taken up Arms against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Warre, my Conscience tells me I had been a Traitor, and guilty of Resisting the Highest Powers. And such Writings, as the (pretended) <hi>French Discovery of the Scotch and English Presbyterie,</hi> abound with so much Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Cause, or Serpentine malice, that they are much uncapable of changing mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that know their vanity. But the Reading of such Books doth make me lament the misery of the World, through the partiality of Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: This Book, and <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s History, and many more that I have lately seen, upon my knowledge do abound with falshoods, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory omissions, and are (in my judgement) as unfit to give Posterity a true Information of our late affairs, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is to tell them the
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:170314:273"/> right way to Heaven. I know I shall highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Authors with saying so; but not so much as they offend God and wrong Posteritie by their falshoods. The foresaid (pretended) <hi>French</hi> Anti-Presbyterian, takes it for granted, that the total Sovereignty was in the King, and upon that, and many such false suppositions, he makes the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the odiousest Traitors under Heaven; So that I do not wonder that Forreign Nations do spit at the very name of an <hi>English</hi> Protestant, as at the name of the Devil: And that Papists make their Ideots believe, That the Protestants in <hi>England</hi> are run stark mad, and turn'd such Rebels as can never more for shame upbraid them with their Laterane Decrees, their Powder-plot, or their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Kings: And what have those Protestants to answer for, that by odious lies do feed these reproaches of the ways of truth, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent servants of the Lord? Yea the said <hi>(Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish) French</hi> Calumniator, most palpably contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth himself, and telleth all the world that he lieth: When he hath charged the Presbyterians with Hypocrisie and Treachery in their Oaths and Covenants for the safety of the King, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he proves by the breach of those Covenants, that they were false in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them: And yet confesseth, that it was other men that broke them, and pull'd them down, to enable them thereto. Our only comfort is, That malice and lying shall not carry it at last, nor pass the final sentence on us.</p>
               <p>If any of them can prove, that I was guilty of hurt to the Person, or destruction of the power
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:170314:274"/> of the King, or of changing the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Commonwealth, taking down the House of Lords, without Consent of all Three Estates that had a part in the Sovereignty; or that I violated the Priviledges of Parliament by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning or excluding the Members, and invaded the Liberties of the People, I will never gainsay them, if they call me a most perfidious Rebel, and tell me that I am guilty of far greater sin than Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Whoredom, Drunkenness, or such like. Or if they can solidly confute my Grounds, I will thank them, and confess my sin to all the world. But mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious railings of them I take for Rebellions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I shall not regard.</p>

               <p>Oh no! his works are glorious, and bear their share of the impress of his excellency. Shall we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to call the heavenly Majesty to account? Must he render a satisfactory reason of his ways, to every worm? Is it not enough to assure us that they are the best, in that he is their Author who is infinitely good? We that are in the Valley of Mortality, and the shadow of death, are yet uncapable of seeing that, which on the Mount of Immortality we shall see to our satisfaction. We see but pieces of the works of God, both as to their extent and their duration. As all the Letters make one word, and all the words do make one sentence, and all the sentences and sections and chapters make one Book, &amp; the use of the letters, syllables, words and sentences, cannot be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood or valued, if taken separated from the whole: no more can we rightly understand &amp; value the works of God, when we see not their relation to the whole. We parcel Arts and Sciences into fragments, according to the straitness of our capacities, and are not so pansophical as <hi>uno intuitu</hi> to see the whole; and therefore we have not the perfect knowledge of any part. As the whole Creation is one entire frame, and no part perfectly known to any, but the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive wisdom that knoweth all; and as the holy Scripture is an entire frame of holy Doctrine; and the work of Sanctification is one new man; so also the works of disposing Providence, are perfectly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, and make up one admirable Systeme, which our non-age hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reth us from understanding. We must learn the Books of God by degrees; word by word, and line by line, and leaf by leaf; but we shall never be ripe Scholars till we have learnt all:
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:170314:276"/> And then we shall see that Nature and Grace, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Creatures, Physicks and Morals, and all the works of God for man, do constitute one most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect frame, which we shall admire for ever. The knowledge of method, is necessary to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the several parts: They borrow much of their sense from their aspect on that which goeth before and cometh after; and the first hath some connexion to the last. The Wheels of a Watch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered separatedly, are useless toys: but in the Frame the smallest Pin is usefull. God seeth all his works at once: were it possible for us to have such a sight, it would answer all our doubts at once. The works of Providence are yet unfinished, and therefore not to be seen in their full beauty: six days sufficed to the Work of Creation; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most six thousand years have not ended the disposals of this present World. Had we seen the Creation after the first or second or third days Work, we should not have seen it in its full beauty: But on the seventh day God rested in it all as very good. A scrap or broken parcel of the most curious picture containeth not the beauty of the <hi>whole,</hi> nor is seen in its <hi>own beauty</hi> but as joyned to the rest. One string of this Instrument maketh no great melody. But when we are perfected, we shall have a more perfect knowledg of the Providences that now we do but spell. What Christ is doing in planting and pulling up in all these disorders of the world, we know not now, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we shall know. The day makes haste, when all those actions shall be opened at once to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon view: when the men that make this bussle in the world are dead and gone, and Prince and people, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:170314:276"/> and Armies are off this Stage, and appear undrest before the Lord, and have received their everlasting recompence, from him that is no respecter of Persons, then Judge of these present ways of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: The end will expound the actions of this day.</p>
               <p>Till then, as we know they are the ways of the most wise, so we must consider how many minds he hath to govern! every man hath an understanding and will of his own! and, O how different! When so many thousand millions of men are of so many minds, or are principled and tempted to so many. We may wonder that such order is preserved in the world. Especially considering that their Interests are almost as various as their minds. Where they should agree they differ; where they are uncapable of a joynt possession, they agree in the desire of that which is impossible. How many have a mind of the same Crowns, the same Honour or Office, or Land, or other bait of worldly vanity: And how easily might Satan set all the world together by the ears, by casting such a bone among them, if God were not the universal King. Mens interests engage them against each other: And their vices are suited to their carnal interests: When humane nature is so corrupt, that vices swarm in the hearts of the ungodly, as worms in a Carrion; when ignorance, self-conceitedness, unbelief, sensuality, pride, worldliness, hypocrisie, and passions of all sorts abound! When so many hearts are blinded and byassed: and all men by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature are enemies to a Holy Peace, &amp; honest Unity must be attained by crossing the very natures and interests of so many; when the best have so much
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:170314:277"/> of these corruptions, and grace that must overpower them is so weak; when the tempter is so subtile, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and uncessant, our temptations to evil, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances to good, so many and so great, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull is that overruling Providence, that keepeth up so much order in the world! and preserveth us from utter confusion and Inormity? It is infinite power that so far uniteth such incoherent matter, and that so far restraineth such corrupted souls: that every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not <hi>Cannibals,</hi> that every Prince is not a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> or <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and every person is not a <hi>Cain,</hi> is all from the wisdom and mercy of our Almighty King. Let God therefore have the honour of his transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Government; He attaineth his ends by that which seems to us Confusion. He is a perfect Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour that perfectly attaineth the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! His ends are known to him, but much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us. The night is usefull as well as the day, and darkness is no dishonour to the Creator. Nor is it dishonourable to him that there are Toads and Serpents on the earth, &amp; that he made not every worm a man, or every man a King, or an Angel: Much less that wicked men do wickedly, when he hath resolved to govern the world in a way consistent with the Liberty of their wills. If sin were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly restrained, and the world reduced to perfect order, we should not have the benefit of persecution, which must be expected by those that will live godly in Christ Jesus. How should we ever express and try our patience &amp; self-denial and contempt of all for the sake of Christ, if we had all things here as we would have them? It argueth too carnal a frame of mind, we are hearkning after felicity, or too great
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:170314:277"/> things on earth, and with the Jews would have a Kingdom of this world, and a Saviour that should make us great on earth: Should we not expect that God in equity and wisdom should keep a proportion of our comfort to our duty, and cause our prosperity to be answerable to our fidelity? If we have lesse here then we expect, and suffer after our faith and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, eternity is long enough to make amends for all: But that a sinfull, careless, hypocritical world, should yet be a prosperous world, is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, unless we would have our portion here. While the world is wilfully so vile, no wonder if it be so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. When sinne makes the greatest breach of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and divideth our hearts from our Creatour, what wonder if lesser disorder do attend it; and we be all divided from each others? And whose conscience will scruple rebellion, resistance, or disobedience against the higher powers, that is hardned in rebellion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and disobedience against God?</p>
               <p>It is a great mistake to expect perfection of so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a thing as holy order here on earth. If we are sure that there will be no perfection of knowledge, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, self-denyal, patience, and all other graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our perfect order, how then can that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be perfect that must result from these? Can ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, froward, imperfect men, make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Church or Commonwealth? Or can we be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer mistaken, then to ascribe to earth the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Heaven? Have we daily experience of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and corruptions in our selves and others? Is not every soul imperfect and disquieted, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? and every Family so too? and every Parish, Corporation, and society so? And can it then be
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:170314:278"/> better in a Commonwealth? Can it be perfect and ordered aright, that is composed of imperfect disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered materials? The whole cannot be gold, where all the parts are stone or iron. Unbelieving souls! repine not in your ignorance against the Lord! When you come to Heaven, and see the perfect order of his Kingdom, and look back with better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the affairs of the world that now offend you, then blame the Lord of imperfection in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if you can? All mercies on earth are but hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the shell: None are here ripe! We must know what earth is, that we may the more thankfully know what Heaven is. We must sow in tears, if we will reap in joy. We must know what sinne is, before we find what grace is; and what grace is, before we find what glory is. If sinne were not suffered to shew it self in the world, and play its part, it would not be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently hated: nor Grace, or Christ, or Heaven suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently valued. We love the godly much the better, because the neighbourhood and tryal of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sheweth us the difference. We are the more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for our own grace, because of the experience of our corruptions. Holy order will be the sweeter to the Saints, because of the odious confusions that stand by. And as it is necessary that Heresie arise, that those which are approved may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; so is it necessary that Warres, confusion, and rebellions arise, that the meek, and peaceable, and obedient may be manifest.</p>
               <p>They are good works as from God, and as to the finall issue, which he accomplisheth by bad Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And when the work is rough, and below his upright ones, he useth to leave it to polluted hands.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:170314:278"/> Even evil Angels are oft his Instruments in afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and God can do good by the Devils: But when there is such a difference between the principal cause and the instrument in the work, and each worketh as he is, and bringeth somewhat of his nature to the effect, no wonder if there be a mixture of order and confusion in the world: and that be sinfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion as from men, that is good and orderly as from God. If there were nothing in the world but what is of God, there would be nothing but what is good. But when Satan hath got so great an Interest, and is become a Prince that ruleth in the Children of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, shall we wonder to find the works of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? Or shall we dare to impute them to the Lord? or blame his Government because the enemy makes disturbance.</p>
               <p>It is the reckoning day that sets all straight. Many are now triumphing whom God laughs to scorn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sees that their day is coming. Till then we must live a life of Faith. If fleshly props be taken from us, and we be left to live on God alone, our comforts will be the more pure, as having little of the creature to defile them. A sensual life is a beastial life. If God were not resolved to hold his servants to a life of Faith, with little mixture of sensible evidence, we should not have such seldom Messengers from the other world; and from age to age have scarce any more then Faith to tell us of the invisible things. When all men that we trusted to are gone, we shall comfort our selves only in the Lord our God. And is he not enough for us alone? How apt are we to draw out from God to men? But when some prove insufficient, and others treacherous, and their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:170314:279"/> is as the waves and weathercocks, we shall cleave the closer to the Rock of Ages, and retire our selves with mortified and Heaven-devoted souls to God. And the more we converse with him, and see him in all the Creatures and their Products, the more we shall perceive his order in their confusions, and their confusions making up his order. But O when we see his blessed face, and behold the glory of the universal King, how sweet an harmony shall we then perceive in the concord of all the motions and affairs that now seem only tumultuary and discordant. We shall see how all these distant lines do meet in God, and in him we shall find all Providences reconciled, and making up one beauteous frame.</p>

               <p>BƲt it is not the disorder that is so much offence, as the quality of the persons from whom it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Shall the work of God be hindered by them that seems his most resolved Servants? Must the cause of Christ be abused by its Friends? and his Church distressed by its Members? These are works that better beseem the enemies, even Satan himself then the Servants of the Lord. Shall we be guilty of the impenitency of the Churches enemies, while we seem to justifie their actions by our own? Must we receive these wounds in the Houses of our Friends? Did we once think that the Gospel must have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered so much by them that were so zealous for it? Our familiar friends, that took sweet counsel with us, and went with us in company to the House of God? Yea still it is professedly for God, that God is
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:170314:279"/> abused and dishonoured: It is for Christ that Christ is so much resisted: It is for the Gospel that men have liberty to deny the Gospel, and dispute against it; and for the Scripture that men have leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and argue against the Scripture, and draw as many as they can into the same condemnation: It is for the Church, that the Church is wounded and torn in pieces, and that the Pastours of it are by license vilified. It is for the godly that the godly are cast out: and it is for the interest of the Saints that liberty is granted to draw men from the waies of sanctity: It is for mens salvation, that liberty is granted to tempt and draw the people to damnation. And it is for the security of the Nation, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Peace and common good, that the Trustees of it are so used, and our security seized upon, as they have oft been: It is for Authority that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath been brought into contempt: and made the football of the world: And if God were not wiser and faithfuller then man, the Church would be utterly destroyed in order to its preservation: and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good would be procured, as the Irish did procure the Peace of <hi>Ireland: Our Brethren that hate us, and cast us out for the Lords Name sake, say, Let the Lord be glorified,</hi> Isa. 66. 5. O lamentable case, that God also must be called upon, and engaged in the Causes which he so abhorres! That he is feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Author of Satans works? That Prayers are engaged against Prayers? and so many Parties fast and pray, and cry to God from morning untill night, with greatest fervency, that he would direct them in his way, and acquaint them with his Truth and Will, and own his cause, and help them in his
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:170314:280"/> work against their Brethren: and all rise up with strengthened confidence, that their cause is right, and are by Prayer animated to their contrary wayes, which in some of them must needs be very evil. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, that the ungodly should be thus tempted to scorn the Prayers of the Saints; and weak ones tempted to suspect their force.</p>
               <p>But did we not know till now that offence must come? and that it will be woe to the world because of offences? (and to them also by whom the offence doth come?) Is it such a wonder for purblind men to stumble? or for children in their hasty running to catch a fall? May not friends fall out and hurt each other in their passion? Friendship is not seen, nor Judgement seen, when Passion is up; but a friend doth seem a very enemy, and a man of Reason seemeth mad. Much more if passion turn to phrensie! What wonder then if the dearest friends have foul words and blows from the distracted? especially if they are loose and armed. The rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of ignorance will have their effects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter that we are imployed in. So far as corruption remaineth unmortified Satan hath so much interest in us: and therefore hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to make use of, and may easily make men Instruments in his work, when he gets the advantage against their graces. But instead of being scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized with my God, or with his holy Truth and Work, let my soul be jealous of it self, and from all these things receive Instruction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, I see here what <hi>Man</hi> is! How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet a Pillar for our confidence? too fickle to be a certain Friend: too feeble to be a sure Support:
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:170314:280"/> too frail to stand in strong temptations, without relief from the Almighty strength: too vile for us to glory in: too blind, too selfish, sinfull, and infirm, to be the Guardian of the Church! Were Godlinesse chiefly entrusted in such hands, and did the Cause and honour of the Lord, depend most on their wisdom, fidelity and innocency, how soon; how certainly would all be lost; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to the enemies scorn? <hi>Cease then from man, whose breath is in his Nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Isa. 2. 22. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord. For he shall be like the heath in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the Wildernesse, in a salt Land, not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is: For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her root by the Rivers, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leafe shall be green, and shall not be carefull in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yeelding fruit,</hi> Jer. 7. 5, 6, 7, 8. Though grace do elevate the soul, and tend to its perfection, yet being imperfect, it leaves man frail, and meeter to be our trouble then our Rest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How dangerous a thing is it to have a mistaking Judgement, in practicals of greatest moment? How lamentably will it misguide their Prayers, their Speeches, and their Practices? And the greater is their zeal, the forwarder will they be to prosecute that evil which they take for good. While they
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:170314:281"/> are pulling down the Church, supposing that they are building it, how resolutely will they proceed? Let but a zealous mans understanding be deluded, and it will engage him in a course of hainous sinne. He will distort all that he readeth or heareth, to the strengthening of his sinne. Sermons and Prayers, and Providences, shall all be prest to serve him in his evil way. How earnestly will he beg of God for assistance in his iniquity, when he thinks it is his duty? How joyfully will he give God thanks for prospering him in doing mischief? What evil will not a man do, if you can but make him think it good? If he kill the holiest Servants of the Lord, he will think that he doth God service by it, and that his peoples blood is an acceptable Sacrifice. Were it the killing of Christ, the Lord of life, they would not stick at it, but say, <hi>Let his blood be on us, and on our Children.</hi> It will drive back all the motions to Repentance, and confirm them in impenitency, and make them angry with all those that approve not of their transgressions, and will not be as bad as they: It will cause them to misinterpret all Gods Providences, and misapply his Promises and Threatnings; and their hearts will rise, with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous indignation against all those that would recover them: Reproofs, though most necessary, they will call Reproaches: and those will be taken for sensorions railers, that tell them of their crimes, though with the tenth part of the plainnesse and seriousnesse as the case requireth. In a word, the disease is strengthened, and secured from the power of all Remedies. Let us therefore beg of God, that he would not leave us to a deluded
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:170314:281"/> mind, nor give us over to the errour of our hearts. O what cause have we to be jealous of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and diffident of our selves, and to prove our way before we make too much hast in it; lest the faster we go, the further we go out of our way! What cause have we to hearken to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the wise, and to be much in learning, and diligent in the use of holy meanes to increase our knowledge? What need have Babes to know their weakness, and keep their due dependance on the strong, and <hi>those that lack wisdome, to ask it of God,</hi> and withall, <hi>to seek for it as silver, and dig for it as for a hidden Treasure,</hi> and to be fearful of falling into forbidden paths?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How dangerous a thing is <hi>Pride of heart?</hi> When once it grows to an enormeous height, it will make men swell with self-conceit, and think none so fit to govern Countries and Nations as they: Nor any so fit to teach the Church: Nor any so meet to judge what is good or evil to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. They will think that God hath qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified them to hold the reines; and if he bring them within the reach of a Crown, or lower Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they will think he offereth it them. How despicably look they on the Judgments and Counsels of men much wiser then themselves? Pride makes every Constable a Justice, and every Souldier a Commander, and every man a King, a Parliament, and a Pope in his own eyes. O what cause have we to watch against this tumifying deluding vice, and to learn of Christ to be meek and lowly, and to behave our selves as Children in his School, and to suspect our understandings,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:170314:282"/> and walk humbly with our God? What Slaughters, what Scandals, what Breaches in the Church, what Triumphs for the Devil, hath Pride wrought in the Earth, and that among them that professe the Faith? And it fortifyeth and defends it self: It will not see it self, nor bear with the means that should disclose it. It hateth faithfull necessary plainnesse, and loveth foolish daubing flattery.

                  </gap>h humble words, will men be proud: with formal confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and daily reprehensions of the Pride of others, and complaints of the abounding of pride in the world; with high applauses of the humble, and zealous exhortations to humility, will men be proud and not observe it. When they read their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Scripture, as that God abhorreth the proud, and knoweth them afar off, and humbleth them that exalt themselves. When they read the Prohibitions of Christ, against sitting down at the upper end, and seeking honour of men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst despising of Dominion, and speaking evil of dignities, and resisting the higher Powers as set over them by God; they read all this as if they read it not: They perceive not the sense of it: They know not that it speaks to them: But as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant unrenewed soul doth hear the substance of the Gospel, but as a lifelesse empty sound, as not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding or favouring the things of the Spirit, so usually do Professors hear or read Texts that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the sins that they are guilty of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How dangerous a thing is it, to grow strange at home? and so unacquainted with our own hearts, as not to know their errours and enormities? If we should but long neglect our Watch, and grow
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:170314:282"/> unobservant of our hearts, how vile will they be, when we think they are upright? and how hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall, when we think they are sincere? and what horrid things may we attempt with good pretences?</p>
               <p n="5">5. How deceitfull a thing is the heart of man? when after so much light and means, after so much teaching and enquiry, after so long self-observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and use of means, and so many discoveries and confessions of sinne, most odious sinnes should so easily creep in, and be indulged and undiscerned, yea befriended and maintained, as if they were the holiest Works? How deceitfull is that heart, that cannot discern the most ugly mountainous transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions? Yea that entitleth them, the Work of God?</p>
               <p n="6">6. How dangerous is it for men to lean to their own understandings, or to hear none but those that are engaged in their own Cause? and to loose and reject the advice of impartial standers by, that have had better opportunities of knowledge then themselves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And how dangerous is it to live under strong temptations? and to have a potent carnal Interest before them! What a byas will such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest be to the understanding, when it should try the good or evil of their wayes? After great Victories, Renown and Honour is become mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest: and how odious is any word or way that would eclipse their honour? If some of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> had been obtained by perfidious Rebellion, how hainously would they have taken it to have been told so, and called to
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:170314:283"/> Repentance, for that which was the matter of their Renowne, and to have their acts of highest Honour numbred with the most odious crimes? What cause have we daily to pray, that God would not lead us into temptation? When Honour, and Dignity, and Command and Wealth, are become a mans Interest, what will he not believe, and do to serve it, if wonderfull grace do not preserve him? Any cause shall seem righteous that promoteth that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; &amp; any Arguments shall seem valid that do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: Gain shall become Godliness: For nothing shall be Godliness that suiteth not with their gain, or other ends: and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> should not be godly, if they crosse their Interest, and especially if they do it plainly and faithfully. And the <hi>Herod</hi> that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced <hi>John</hi> Baptist, and heard him gladly, will yield to the cutting off his Head, if <hi>Herodias</hi> be once dearer to him then the Lord. How excellent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary is self-denial? How dangerous a standing have the Rulers and Commanders of the world? What a folly is it to envy them, or desire to be in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? What wonder, if few of the great and rich are saved? and if it be <hi>as hard for them to enter into Heaven, as for a Camell to go through a needles eye,</hi> how little cause have the low and poor to murmur at their condition? Experience hath taught me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, that I will never put confidence in my nearest Friend, nor the best man that I know, if once he have a potent carnal Interest, and dwell among great and strong temptations. Though I doubt not but God hath his humble ones, whom he preserveth even in such assaults, yet how rare is it for Cedars long to stand, on the tops of Mountains? <hi>Man being in honour
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:170314:283"/> and not understanding, is like the beasts that perish, Psal.</hi> 49. 20.</p>
               <p n="8">8. How dangerous a thing is it to be once enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a sinful way? The further they go, the more their engagements will increase: How hard will it be to return, when once they have set foot in a course of sinne? Their interest then will lead them to impiety, and even to persecution it self; and to take Christ, and Scripture, and faithfull Ministers for their enemies. For all these are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged against sinne, which the guilty soul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in; Christ and Scripture do condemn it: Ministers must (as they have a Call) reprove it; and faithfull Christians must disown it: and this will enrage the guilty soul. The guilty have not the patience of the Innocent. Had I wrote that to the view of ten thousand that are Innocent, which hath so exasperated the guilty, it would not so much as have offended them. As <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>It hurteth them that have sores, to think that they are touched, though you touch them not.</hi> Fear makes them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as if they were hurt: The sick and sore are impatient and querulous. And all that defendeth them in the sinfull way that they are ingaged in, they like and own: And so they go on from sinne to sinne, deceiving and being deceived. And if God have so much mercy for them, as to recover them by Repentance; How dear must it cost them, in comparison of what a prevention would have done?</p>
               <p n="9">9. How dangerous is it for uncalled men, to dream that every opportunity is a Call, to meddle with things above their reach, and seize upon Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:170314:284"/> which they are unfit for? When men that have not had the inward and outward opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and helps for holy knowledge; which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ must have, will invade the Office upon a proud conceit of a fitness which they have not; or will be more peremptory in their judgement in Theological difficulties, then is suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the proportion of their knowledge; and when men unacquainted with the true Principles of Government, will be rashly condemning the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Governours, and turning them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Saddle, that they may get up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when ever they have a conceit that their Governours erre, and that themselves are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and can govern better; what an Ocean of iniquity doth this presumption plunge them into?</p>
               <p n="10">10. What delusions doth a galled Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betray men to? When they have done evil, in stead of Repenting, they would fain bring others to approve their deeds, and fain have them justified before the world? And what if they were? Doth this conduce to their Justification before God? Is this any salve to a wounded soul? Will God absolve them, because men do it? What figg-leaves are these, that will not hide their nakednesse from Posterity, much lesse from God.</p>
               <p n="11">11. How abundantly hath experience satisfied me of the blessednesse of Peace, and the mischiefs of Warre, from the ordinary effects of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soul. In Peace when we live in quiet Neighbourhood, and in Church-order, men are
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:170314:284"/> esteemed among us according to their real worth: A poor Christian that is of excellent parts, and of a holy exemplary life, is he that bears the Bell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and the scandalous are presently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and noted to their just contempt and shame, <hi>(Psal. 15. 4. 2 Thess.</hi> 3. 14.) and froathy, wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, proud Professors, that know nothing but dote about words that gender strife, and edifie not, are looked upon as the spots in our Assemblies: so that Humility, Innocency and Edification here, bear all the glory and the sway. But in the Armies, some of our hopefull Professors turn'd Drunkards (and when they came home, we could scarce recover them;) some turned away from Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Ordinances, Scripture, Godlinesse, from Christ, and from common Sobriety and Civility: Some that sped best, lament their coolings, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and discomposure of soul, and are other men in Peace, as to the beauty and integrity of their lives, than they were in Warre. And (which is the thing I aim at) true Godlinesse and Vice are seldom rightly estimated in Warre. A slip into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse is excused there as a necessary evil. A railing word, or rude behaviour and unseemly carriage, is accounted not much unbeseeming Souldiers for the most part: A great deal of humility and real worth in a private Souldier is buried, and too little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served or operative on others: When an half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted Officer, or one that is notional, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and ignorant, may be heard and regarded, as if his erroneous words were Oracles. So great is the Interest of Commanders in their Souldiers, that those have been there honoured and followed
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:170314:285"/> as men of notable parts and piety, and born much sway, that when they have returned to their Trades, and lived among their able, humble, upright Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, have appeared to be of the lowest forme. I doubt not but Armies, have persons of the highest worth: But I have seen that ignorance, pride and errour, have far more advantage to gain reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and play their game, to leaven others, and rule the rost in a military state, then they have in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Church-state.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I see more and more, how impossible it is, that honest, plain, and faithful dealing, in Ministers or others, should ordinarily find acceptance in the world! We must expect to displease God or men, when men will swerve from the wayes of God: God or the guilty will condemn us: Conscience or engaged galled persons will censure us, and swell against us. While their Doctrines or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are unreconcilable to God, our Doctrine and reproofs will be offensive unto them. And whose pleasure and favour shall I chuse? Not mans, but Gods: For thy pleasure, O Lord, was I crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: In thy favour is life: Or if men be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deprive me of my life; thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is better than life. Men are corrupt: and honesty will not alway please, when they pretend to honesty: They are giddy, and will not be long pleased with one thing: And I cannot change as fast as they. Their Interests call for that to please them, which is against the Interest of Christ, the Church, and my own, and others souls. And shall I sell all these for the favour of man! Of a lump of dirt, that shortly will be loathed by those that
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:170314:285"/> now flatter them? Men are so many, and of so many contrary Interests and minds, that I cannot possibly please all, or many: and which then shall I please? Nay one mans mind is so contrary to it self, that if I please him in one thing, I must displease him in another. The holiest Apostles and Pastors of the Church, have not pleased them. Christ did not please them: God doth not please them: and how should I?</p>
               <p>My God! I am satisfied! May I but please thee; I have enough. How easily may I spare the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of man, whose breath is in his nostrils, if I have thy favour? He that cannot be satisfied in thee, will never be satisfied. I covenanted not with thee, for the favour of the best of men; when I became they servant: but that thou shouldst be my God in Christ. Let me have this, and I declare to all the world, that thou hast made good thy holy Covenant, and I have that which I agreed for. O that I had more faithfully pleased thee, though I had displeased high and low, Princes and Armies, and all the world. The favour of man cannot continue my soul in life: I must be sick, and die, and rot in the grave, if I have the favour of all the world. But if God be for me, who shall be against me! All things shall work together for my good: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ liveth, I shall live. The wounds of my soul are not for displeasing men, but thee! The frowns of the greatest leave no sting behind them in my heart: But who can bear the frowns of God? My God! it is not earthly men, that I must live with long! How long have I looked for thy Call! It is thee that I must live with for ever. And therefore.
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:170314:286"/> how little doth it concern me, whether I be loved or hated here? Those that shall live with me in thy presence, will all be reconciled by the light of thy Face, and the power of thy Eternal Love. The rest are not of my Communion. It woundeth not my conscience that I have honoured thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which preserved this Nation from so much guilt: nor that I preferred the honour of thy Cause and Churches, before the honour of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And the demands of <hi>Folly and Impiety</hi> are not regardable. I thank thee for wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing my soul from man! but let it not now be estranged from thee. I stand to my Covenant! I give up all! for all is nothing: But then let me have thee, that indeed art all! Forsake me not, that consent to forsake all for thee; and should not have consented, if thou hadst forsaken me. The darknesse and distance of my soul from thee, is more grievous to me than all the frowns of men! Alas my God, that I can know thee no more, after so many and gracious discoveries! That I love thee no more, that by so many mercies hast restified thy love, and done so much to convince me that thou art most Lovely; this, this is the prison, the famine, the sicknesse, and I had almost said the death of my languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drooping, fainting soul! That I have thought, and read, and heard, and said so much of Heaven,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:170314:286"/> the Rest of Saints, and yet my soul can reach no higher, and get no nearer, and believe, and love, and long no more; these, Lord are the wounds and scourges that I suffer! I may not open my brest with <hi>Camero,</hi> and say, <hi>Feri miser;</hi> but I may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with <hi>Luther,</hi> and say, <hi>Feri Domine, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter feri,</hi> if I had but more of the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy love, and more of the tasts of Heaven upon my soul. I refuse not the stocks of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> nor their scourges neither, so I might have their heavenly visits and elevation, which might tune my soul to their delightful melody. Were I but free from the Prison of my ignorance, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and other sinnes, how easily could I bear the imprisonment of my body! Were I with <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Patmos,</hi> so I might also be with him in the Spirit, I would rather call it a Paradise, than a Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What can it be but thy presence or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that may denominate places and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a <hi>Homo,</hi> or a <hi>Banishment, Liberty</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, Sweet</hi> or <hi>Bitter, Happy</hi> or <hi>Miserable.</hi> Were there a Countrey on Earth that had more of God, and where the Sunne of his face doth shine more brightly, and where Heaven is opener unto earth, and the Spirit hath more illuminating, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning influences on the souls of men; O that I were banished thither! How cheerfully, how speedily would I go seek that place? But while I carry my Gaoler and my Prison about me, and am fettered in my own corruptions and infirmities, alas, in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> I am <hi>not free;</hi> while I am honoured and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, I am ashamed of my self: While I am <hi>Loved</hi> of others, I <hi>loath</hi> my self: Though my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:170314:287"/> be afflicted by none without me, (but by thy just and gracious castigations, which I have born even from my youth) yet how can it chuse but droop and languish, that is animated by an afflicted soul? How oft do my <hi>Bodily</hi> pains seem <hi>nothing,</hi> being over-sensed with my souls more grievous languishings? So long have I been a Prisoner at <hi>Home,</hi> that I could long for a Prison that would but bring me nearer <hi>Home.</hi> The <hi>darknesse</hi> that I live in in the open light, doth make me think that <hi>Dungeon</hi> happy, where souls are more open to thy celestial Rayes. I wonder not at the Labours and Patience of holy <hi>Paul,</hi> when I consider what Spirit dwelt within him, and what a sight he had had of Christ, and whither he was wrapt, and what he saw. The sight of Christ in his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation was much; but the glimpse of a glorified Christ was more, though mixt with somewhat of rebuke and terrour. To be taken up into the third Heavens, and there see things to us unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, must needs be an effectual Motive, to all that holy diligence and patience, and a reward exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that we can do or suffer. Much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy are the sufferings of this present life, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory that shall be revealed. It will be a small thing to him to be judged of men, that knoweth that there is one that judgeth, even the Lord; and seeth by faith, the Judge even at the door. Were I fully certain that my sinnes could do no more against me, at the barre of God, then all the censures, displeasures, reproaches or persecutions of men can do, how little should I fear that dreadful day! Might I but finish my course
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:170314:287"/> with joy, why should I count life or liberty dear? Let me be equal with the most afflicted of thy Saints, so I may but believe, and love as much as the holiest. Might I but have their measure of the Spirit, how gladly should I submit to their measure of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Might I see what <hi>Stephen</hi> saw, how gladly would I suffer what he suffered! But I dare not, I must not thus capitulate with God! The times and measures of the Reward are in thy hand. Much lower termes are very high. Dispose of me therefore according to thy gracious will. Thy will is the Original and the End, of me and all things. From it I seek for guidance, safety, strength and happiness. By it let me be directed and disposed: In it alone let my soul have Rest. <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
